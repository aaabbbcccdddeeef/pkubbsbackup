**Noam Chomsky joins academics boycotting China Marxism conferences**
Academics respond to detention of students who supported workers trying to unionise
                                        
Yuan Yang in Beijing 11 hours ago
                        
Noam Chomsky has joined more than 30 scholars from around the 
world calling for a boycott of Marxism conferences in China as part of 
the international backlash against Beijing’s crackdown on students 
organising pro-workers groups.
The academics are mostly from 
leading US and UK universities and apart from Prof Chomsky, a 
linguistics scholar at the University of Arizona, include John Roemer, 
professor of political science and economics at Yale University.
In
 a statement seen by the Financial Times, Prof Chomsky wrote: “To 
continue to participate in . . . officially sponsored Marxism-related 
events means we would stay complicit in the Chinese government’s game. 
Leftist scholars around the world should join the boycott of such 
conferences and events.”
The academics were responding to the 
detention of students from China’s top universities over the past four 
months. The students had been supporting workers trying to unionise
 in a Jasic Technology factory in Shenzhen, the southern manufacturing 
hub. About 20 students and recent graduates are still in detention, the 
Jasic Workers’ Solidarity Group said, as well as five factory workers 
and other supporters.
“The fact that the Chinese government is 
suppressing such students — even kidnapping them — exposes the political
 leadership as sham Marxists,” wrote Prof Roemer.<img src=""/>
                                                                        
                                                
                                        
                
                                
                        
                
                                        
                                
China’s government has grown increasingly intolerant of all forms
 of grassroots organising under President Xi Jinping’s rule. Although 
Communist in name, the party is particularly nervous about a nationwide 
collective of students finding solidarity with workers, an alliance at 
the root of its own origins as a revolutionary party.
Last month, Cornell University
 suspended two student exchanges with China’s Renmin University. The Ivy
 League institution was concerned that Renmin was punishing students for
 supporting workers, which Cornell described as a “a violation of 
academic freedom”. Renmin denied the accusation.
Two weeks ago another wave of students was arrested or kidnapped,
 including Zhang Shengye. The recent Peking University graduate was 
bundled into a car on campus by “men in black clothing”, according to 
student witnesses.
Other students have been followed by police and closely watched by teachers.
“Based
 on information we have gathered, more students are still at risk,” 
wrote a group of academics including Elaine Hui, an assistant professor 
at Penn State University, who made the initial call to boycott China’s 
World Congress on Marxism and “similar conferences”.
Last month 
the government announced that Qiu Shuiping, a former state security 
official, had been appointed party secretary of Peking University. The 
appointment was interpreted by some as the start of a more authoritarian
 environment at the university. 
Peking University’s Communist 
party unit is also setting up two offices to perform internal 
“disciplinary inspections” and “control and management”, according to a 
leaked directive.
Peking University did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.
Leslie
 Sklair, professor emeritus of sociology at the London School of 
Economics, wrote that he would urge his colleagues “to scrutinise ties 
between their universities and leading Chinese universities complicit in
 this repression”.
