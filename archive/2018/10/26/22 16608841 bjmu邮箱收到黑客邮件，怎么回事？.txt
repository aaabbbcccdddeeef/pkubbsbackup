大家的学校或医学部邮箱有被异地登录过吗？
今天收到一封黑客邮件，有点懵逼？？？？
邮件内容如下：
Hello!
My nickname in darknet is des53.
I hacked this mailbox more than six months ago. Through it I infected your operating system with a virus (trojan) created by me and have been monitoring you for a long time.
Even if you changed the password after that - it does not matter, my virus intercepted all the caching data on your computer
and automatically saved access for me.
I have access to all your accounts, social networks, email, browsing history.
Accordingly, I have the data of all your contacts, files from your computer, photos and videos.
I was most struck by the adult sites that you occasionally visit.
You have a very wild imagination, I tell you!
During your pastime and entertainment there, I took screenshot through the camera of your device, synchronizing with what you are watching.
Oh my god! You were so funny and excited!
I think that you do not want all your contacts to get these files, right?
If you are of the same opinion, then I think that $900 is quite a fair price to destroy the dirt I created.
Send the above amount to my Bitcoin wallet: 37DR57mnHSTtxTFJgRQG2ejT6Y28KNtkrq
As soon as the above amount is received, I guarantee that the data will be deleted, I do not need it.
Otherwise, these files and history of visiting sites will get all your contacts from your device.
Also, I'll send to everyone your contact access to your email and access logs, which I have carefully saved.
Since reading this letter you have 48 hours!
After your reading this message, I'll receive an automatic notification that you have seen the letter.
I hope I taught you a good lesson.
Visit safe websites only, and don't enter your passwords anywhere!
Good luck!﻿

这是诈骗不是黑客吧
