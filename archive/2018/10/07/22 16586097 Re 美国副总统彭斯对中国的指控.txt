我通读文章感觉文中的例子基本属实。
指控所说的也基本是特朗普的竞选观点。
全球化过程中美国跨国公司获得的巨大利益也远大于仅仅处于制造者位置的中国公司。把自己国家内部的分配不均的锅甩给中国，跟自由派把竞选失败归咎于俄国干涉大选一样。
对于中国49年前历史的引用，仿佛在暗示我们指望美国给中国带来进步也是可笑至极。我再不喜欢现在的政策，我也不会否认49年前他们资助的政府是落后愚蠢，代表少数人利益的。
指望国家的进步，只能依靠自己的国民。这篇演讲在我看来只是在强调他们对于自己国家利益的捍卫，所谓的共赢都是空中楼阁般的虚妄承诺。

The Hudson Institute
Washington, D.C.
11:07 A.M. EDT
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Ken, for that kind introduction. To 
the Members of the Board of Trustees, to Dr. Michael Pillsbury, to our 
distinguished guests, and to all of you who, true to your mission in 
this place, “think about the future in unconventional ways” –- it is an 
honor to be back at the Hudson Institute.
For more than a half a century, this Institute has dedicated itself 
to “advancing global security, prosperity, and freedom.” And while 
Hudson’s hometowns have changed over the years, one thing has been 
constant: You have always advanced that vital truth, that American 
leadership lights the way.
And today, speaking of leadership, allow me to begin by bringing 
greetings from a great champion of American leadership at home and 
abroad –- I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States
 of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)
From early in this administration, President Trump has made our 
relationship with China and President Xi a priority. On April 6th of 
last year, President Trump welcomed President Xi to Mar-a-Lago. On 
November 8th of last year, President Trump traveled to Beijing, where 
China’s leader welcomed him warmly.
Over the course of the past two years, our President has forged a 
strong personal relationship with the President of the People’s Republic
 of China, and they’ve worked closely on issues of common interest, most
 importantly the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
But I come before you today because the American people deserve to 
know that, as we speak, Beijing is employing a whole-of-government 
approach, using political, economic, and military tools, as well as 
propaganda, to advance its influence and benefit its interests in the 
United States.
China is also applying this power in more proactive ways than ever 
before, to exert influence and interfere in the domestic policy and 
politics of this country.
Under President Trump’s leadership, the United States has taken 
decisive action to respond to China with American action, applying the 
principles and the policies long advocated in these halls.
In our National Security Strategy that the President Trump released 
last December, he described a new era of “great power competition.” 
Foreign nations have begun to, as we wrote, “reassert their influence 
regionally and globally,” and they are “contesting [America’s] 
geopolitical advantages and trying [in essence] to change the 
international order in their favor.”
In this strategy, President Trump made clear that the United States 
of America has adopted a new approach to China. We seek a relationship 
grounded in fairness, reciprocity, and respect for sovereignty, and we 
have taken strong and swift action to achieve that goal.
As the President said last year on his visit to China, in his words, 
“we have an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between our two 
countries and improve the lives of our citizens.” Our vision of the 
future is built on the best parts of our past, when America and China 
reached out to one another in a spirit of openness and friendship.
When our young nation went searching in the wake of the Revolutionary
 War for new markets for our exports, the Chinese people welcomed 
American traders laden with ginseng and fur.
When China suffered through indignities and exploitations during her 
so-called “Century of Humiliation,” America refused to join in, and 
advocated the “Open Door” policy, so that we could have freer trade with
 China, and preserve their sovereignty.
When American missionaries brought the good news to China’s shores, 
they were moved by the rich culture of an ancient and vibrant people. 
And not only did they spread their faith, but those same missionaries 
founded some of China’s first and finest universities.
When the Second World War arose, we stood together as allies in the 
fight against imperialism. And in that war’s aftermath, America ensured 
that China became a charter member of the United Nations, and a great 
shaper of the post-war world.
But soon after it took power in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party 
began to pursue authoritarian expansionism. It is remarkable to think 
that only five years after our nations had fought together, we fought 
each other in the mountains and valleys of the Korean Peninsula. My own 
father saw combat on that frontier of freedom.
But not even the brutal Korean War could diminish our mutual desire 
to restore the ties that for so long had bound our peoples together. 
China’s estrangement from the United States ended in 1972, and, soon 
after, we re-established diplomatic relations and began to open our 
economies to one another, and American universities began training a new
 generation of Chinese engineers, business leaders, scholars, and 
officials.
After the fall of the Soviet Union, we assumed that a free China was 
inevitable. Heady with optimism at the turn of the 21st Century, America
 agreed to give Beijing open access to our economy, and we brought China
 into the World Trade Organization.
Previous administrations made this choice in the hope that freedom in
 China would expand in all of its forms -– not just economically, but 
politically, with a newfound respect for classical liberal principles, 
private property, personal liberty, religious freedom — the entire 
family of human rights. But that hope has gone unfulfilled.
The dream of freedom remains distant for the Chinese people. And 
while Beijing still pays lip service to “reform and opening,” Deng 
Xiaoping’s famous policy now rings hollow.
Over the past 17 years, China’s GDP has grown nine-fold; it’s become 
the second-largest economy in the world. Much of this success was driven
 by American investment in China. And the Chinese Communist Party has 
also used an arsenal of policies inconsistent with free and fair trade, 
including tariffs, quotas, currency manipulation, forced technology 
transfer, intellectual property theft, and industrial subsidies that are
 handed out like candy to foreign investment. These policies have built 
Beijing’s manufacturing base, at the expense of its competitors -– 
especially the United States of America.
China’s actions have contributed to a trade deficit with the United 
States that last year ran to $375 billion –- nearly half of our global 
trade deficit. As President Trump said just this week, in his words, “We
 rebuilt China” over the last 25 years.
Now, through the “Made in China 2025” plan, the Communist Party has 
set its sights on controlling 90 percent of the world’s most advanced 
industries, including robotics, biotechnology, and artificial 
intelligence. To win the commanding heights of the 21st century economy,
 Beijing has directed its bureaucrats and businesses to obtain American 
intellectual property –- the foundation of our economic leadership -– by
 any means necessary.
Beijing now requires many American businesses to hand over their 
trade secrets as the cost of doing business in China. It also 
coordinates and sponsors the acquisition of American firms to gain 
ownership of their creations. Worst of all, Chinese security agencies 
have masterminded the wholesale theft of American technology –- 
including cutting-edge military blueprints. And using that stolen 
technology, the Chinese Communist Party is turning plowshares into 
swords on a massive scale.
China now spends as much on its military as the rest of Asia 
combined, and Beijing has prioritized capabilities to erode America’s 
military advantages on land, at sea, in the air, and in space. China 
wants nothing less than to push the United States of America from the 
Western Pacific and attempt to prevent us from coming to the aid of our 
allies. But they will fail.
Beijing is also using its power like never before. Chinese ships 
routinely patrol around the Senkaku Islands, which are administered by 
Japan. And while China’s leader stood in the Rose Garden at the White 
House in 2015 and said that his country had, and I quote, “no intention 
to militarize” the South China Sea, today, Beijing has deployed advanced
 anti-ship and anti-air missiles atop an archipelago of military bases 
constructed on artificial islands.
China’s aggression was on display this week, when a Chinese naval 
vessel came within 45 yards of the USS Decatur as it conducted 
freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea, forcing our 
ship to quickly maneuver to avoid collision. Despite such reckless 
harassment, the United States Navy will continue to fly, sail, and 
operate wherever international law allows and our national interests 
demand. We will not be intimidated and we will not stand down. 
(Applause.)
America had hoped that economic liberalization would bring China into
 a greater partnership with us and with the world. Instead, China has 
chosen economic aggression, which has in turn emboldened its growing 
military.
Nor, as we had hoped, has Beijing moved toward greater freedom for 
its own people. For a time, Beijing inched toward greater liberty and 
respect for human rights. But in recent years, China has taken a sharp 
U-turn toward control and oppression of its own people.
Today, China has built an unparalleled surveillance state, and it’s 
growing more expansive and intrusive – often with the help of U.S. 
technology. What they call the “Great Firewall of China” likewise grows 
higher, drastically restricting the free flow of information to the 
Chinese people.
And by 2020, China’s rulers aim to implement an Orwellian system 
premised on controlling virtually every facet of human life — the 
so-called “Social Credit Score.” In the words of that program’s official
 blueprint, it will “allow the trustworthy to roam everywhere under 
heaven, while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step.”
And when it comes to religious freedom, a new wave of persecution is 
crashing down on Chinese Christians, Buddhists, and Muslims.
Last month, Beijing shut down one of China’s largest underground 
churches. Across the country, authorities are tearing down crosses, 
burning bibles, and imprisoning believers. And Beijing has now reached a
 deal with the Vatican that gives the avowedly atheist Communist Party a
 direct role in appointing Catholic bishops. For China’s Christians, 
these are desperate times.
Beijing is also cracking down on Buddhism. Over the past decade, more
 than 150 Tibetan Buddhist monks have lit themselves on fire to protest 
China’s repression of their beliefs and their culture. And in Xinjiang, 
the Communist Party has imprisoned as many as one million Muslim Uyghurs
 in government camps where they endure around-the-clock brainwashing. 
Survivors of the camps have described their experiences as a deliberate 
attempt by Beijing to strangle Uyghur culture and stamp out the Muslim 
faith.
As history attests though, a country that oppresses its own people 
rarely stops there. And Beijing also aims to extend its reach across the
 wider world. As Hudson’s own Dr. Michael Pillsbury has written, “China 
has opposed the actions and goals of the U.S. government. Indeed, China 
is building its own relationships with America’s allies and enemies that
 contradict any peaceful or productive intentions of Beijing.”
In fact, China uses so-called “debt diplomacy” to expand its 
influence. Today, that country is offering hundreds of billions of 
dollars in infrastructure loans to governments from Asia to Africa to 
Europe and even Latin America. Yet the terms of those loans are opaque 
at best, and the benefits invariably flow overwhelmingly to Beijing.
Just ask Sri Lanka, which took on massive debt to let Chinese state 
companies build a port of questionable commercial value. Two years ago, 
that country could no longer afford its payments, so Beijing pressured 
Sri Lanka to deliver the new port directly into Chinese hands. It may 
soon become a forward military base for China’s growing blue-water navy.
Within our own hemisphere, Beijing has extended a lifeline to the 
corrupt and incompetent Maduro regime in Venezuela that’s been 
oppressing its own people. They pledged $5 billion in questionable loans
 to be repaid with oil. China is also that country’s single largest 
creditor, saddling the Venezuelan people with more than $50 billion in 
debt, even as their democracy vanishes. Beijing is also impacting some 
nations’ politics by providing direct support to parties and candidates 
who promise to accommodate China’s strategic objectives.
And since last year alone, the Chinese Communist Party has convinced 
three Latin American nations to sever ties with Taipei and recognize 
Beijing. These actions threaten the stability of the Taiwan Strait, and 
the United States of America condemns these actions. And while our 
administration will continue to respect our One China Policy, as 
reflected in the three joint communiqués and the Taiwan Relations Act, 
America will always believe that Taiwan’s embrace of democracy shows a 
better path for all the Chinese people. (Applause.)
Now these are only a few of the ways that China has sought to advance
 its strategic interests across the world, with growing intensity and 
sophistication. Yet previous administrations all but ignored China’s 
actions. And in many cases, they abetted them. But those days are over.
Under President Trump’s leadership, the United States of America has 
been defending our interests with renewed American strength.
We’ve been making the strongest military in the history of the world 
stronger still. Earlier this year, President Trump signed into law the 
largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan
 -– $716 billion to extend the strength of the American military to 
every domain.
We’re modernizing our nuclear arsenal. We’re fielding and developing 
new cutting-edge fighters and bombers. We’re building a new generation 
of aircraft carriers and warships. We’re investing as never before in 
our armed forces. And this includes initiating the process to establish 
the United States Space Force to ensure our continued dominance in 
space, and we’ve taken action to authorize increased capability in the 
cyber world to build deterrence against our adversaries.
At President Trump’s direction, we’re also implementing tariffs on 
$250 billion in Chinese goods, with the highest tariffs specifically 
targeting the advanced industries that Beijing is trying to capture and 
control. And as the President has also made clear, we will levy even 
more tariffs, with the possibility of substantially more than doubling 
that number, unless a fair and reciprocal deal is made. (Applause.)
These actions — exercises in American strength — have had a major 
impact. China’s largest stock exchange fell by 25 percent in the first 
nine months of this year, in large part because our administration has 
been standing strong against Beijing’s trade practices.
As President Trump has made clear, we don’t want China’s markets to 
suffer. In fact, we want them to thrive. But the United States wants 
Beijing to pursue trade policies that are free, fair, and reciprocal. 
And we will continue to stand and demand that they do. (Applause.)
Sadly, China’s rulers, thus far, have refused to take that path. The 
American people deserve to know: In response to the strong stand that 
President Trump has taken, Beijing is pursuing a comprehensive and 
coordinated campaign to undermine support for the President, our agenda,
 and our nation’s most cherished ideals.
I want to tell you today what we know about China’s actions here at 
home — some of which we’ve gleaned from intelligence assessments, some 
of which are publicly available. But all of which are fact.
As I said before, as we speak, Beijing is employing a 
whole-of-government approach to advance its influence and benefit its 
interests. It’s employing this power in more proactive and coercive ways
 to interfere in the domestic policies of this country and to interfere 
in the politics of the United States.
The Chinese Communist Party is rewarding or coercing American 
businesses, movie studios, universities, think tanks, scholars, 
journalists, and local, state, and federal officials.
And worst of all, China has initiated an unprecedented effort to 
influence American public opinion, the 2018 elections, and the 
environment leading into the 2020 presidential elections. To put it 
bluntly, President Trump’s leadership is working; and China wants a 
different American President.
There can be no doubt: China is meddling in America’s democracy. As 
President Trump said just last week, we have, in his words, “found that 
China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming [midterm] 
election[s].”
Our intelligence community says that “China is targeting U.S. state 
and local governments and officials to exploit any divisions between 
federal and local levels on policy. It’s using wedge issues, like trade 
tariffs, to advance Beijing’s political influence.”
In June, Beijing itself circulated a sensitive document, entitled 
“Propaganda and Censorship Notice.” It laid out its strategy. It stated 
that China must, in their words, “strike accurately and carefully, 
splitting apart different domestic groups” in the United States of 
America.
To that end, Beijing has mobilized covert actors, front groups, and 
propaganda outlets to shift Americans’ perception of Chinese policy. As a
 senior career member of our intelligence community told me just this 
week, what the Russians are doing pales in comparison to what China is 
doing across this country. And the American people deserve to know it.
Senior Chinese officials have also tried to influence business 
leaders to encourage them to condemn our trade actions, leveraging their
 desire to maintain their operations in China. In one recent example, 
China threatened to deny a business license for a major U.S. corporation
 if they refused to speak out against our administration’s policies.
And when it comes to influencing the midterms, you need only look at 
Beijing’s tariffs in response to ours. The tariffs imposed by China to 
date specifically targeted industries and states that would play an 
important role in the 2018 election. By one estimate, more than 80 
percent of U.S. counties targeted by China voted for President Trump and
 I in 2016; now China wants to turn these voters against our 
administration.
And China is also directly appealing to the American voters. Last 
week, the Chinese government paid to have a multipage supplement 
inserted into the Des Moines Register –- the paper of record of the home
 state of our Ambassador to China, and a pivotal state in 2018 and 2020.
 The supplement, designed to look like the news articles, cast our trade
 policies as reckless and harmful to Iowans.
Fortunately, Americans aren’t buying it. For example, American 
farmers are standing with this President and are seeing real results 
from the strong stands that he’s taken, including this week’s 
U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, where we’ve substantially opened North 
American markets to U.S. products. The USMCA is a great win for American
 farmers and American manufacturers. (Applause.)
But China’s actions aren’t focused solely on influencing our policies
 and politics. Beijing is also taking steps to exploit its economic 
leverage, and the allure of their large marketplace, to advance its 
influence over American businesses.
Beijing now requires American joint ventures that operate in China to
 establish what they call “party organizations” within their company, 
giving the Communist Party a voice –- and perhaps a veto -– in hiring 
and investment decisions.
Chinese authorities have also threatened U.S. companies that depict 
Taiwan as a distinct geographic entity, or that stray from Chinese 
policy on Tibet. Beijing compelled Delta Airlines to publicly apologize 
for not calling Taiwan a “province of China” on its website. And it 
pressured Marriott to fire a U.S. employee who merely liked a tweet 
about Tibet.
And Beijing routinely demands that Hollywood portray China in a 
strictly positive light. It punishes studios and producers that don’t. 
Beijing’s censors are quick to edit or outlaw movies that criticize 
China, even in minor ways. For the movie, “World War Z,” they had to cut
 the script’s mention of a virus because it originated in China. The 
movie, “Red Dawn” was digitally edited to make the villains North 
Korean, not Chinese.
But beyond business and entertainment, the Chinese Communist Party is
 also spending billions of dollars on propaganda outlets in the United 
States and, frankly, around the world.
China Radio International now broadcasts Beijing-friendly programs on
 over 30 U.S. outlets, many in major American cities. The China Global 
Television Network reaches more than 75 million Americans, and it gets 
its marching orders directly from its Communist Party masters. As 
China’s top leader put it during a visit to the network’s headquarters, 
and I quote, “The media run by the Party and the government are 
propaganda fronts and must have the Party as their surname.”
It’s for those reasons and that reality that, last month, the 
Department of Justice ordered that network to register as a foreign 
agent.
The Communist Party has also threatened and detained the Chinese 
family members of American journalists who pry too deep. And it’s 
blocked the websites of U.S. media organizations and made it harder for 
our journalists to get visas. This happened after the New York Times 
published investigative reports about the wealth of some of China’s 
leaders.
But the media isn’t the only place where the Chinese Communist Party 
seeks to foster a culture of censorship. The same is true across 
academia.
I mean, look no further than the Chinese Students and Scholars 
Association, of which there are more than 150 branches across America’s 
campuses. These groups help organize social events for some of the more 
than 430,000 Chinese nationals studying in the United States. They also 
alert Chinese consulates and embassies when Chinese students, and 
American schools, stray from the Communist Party line.
At the University of Maryland, a Chinese student recently spoke at 
her graduation of what she called, and I quote, the “fresh air of free 
speech” in America. The Communist Party’s official newspaper swiftly 
chastised her. She became the victim of a firestorm of criticism on 
China’s tightly-controlled social media, and her family back home was 
harassed. As for the university itself, its exchange program with China —
 one of the nation’s most extensive — suddenly turned from a flood to a 
trickle.
China exerts academic pressure in other ways, as well. Beijing 
provides generous funding to universities, think tanks, and scholars, 
with the understanding that they will avoid ideas that the Communist 
Party finds dangerous or offensive. China experts in particular know 
that their visas will be delayed or denied if their research contradicts
 Beijing’s talking points.
And even scholars and groups who avoid Chinese funding are targeted 
by that country, as the Hudson Institute found out firsthand. After you 
offered to host a speaker Beijing didn’t like, your website suffered a 
major cyberattack, originating from Shanghai. The Hudson Institute knows
 better than most that the Chinese Communist Party is trying to 
undermine academic freedom and the freedom of speech in America today.
These and other actions, taken as a whole, constitute an intensifying
 effort to shift American public opinion and policy away from the 
“America First” leadership of President Donald Trump.
But our message to China’s rulers is this: This President will not 
back down. (Applause.) The American people will not be swayed. And we 
will continue to stand strong for our security and our economy, even as 
we hope for improved relations with Beijing.
Our administration is going to continue to act decisively to protect America’s interests, American jobs, and American security.
As we rebuild our military, we will continue to assert American interests across the Indo-Pacific.
As we respond to China’s trade practices, we will continue to demand 
an economic relationship with China that is free, fair, and reciprocal. 
We will demand that Beijing break down its trade barriers, fulfill its 
obligations, fully open its economy — just as we have opened ours.
We’ll continue to take action against Beijing until the theft of 
American intellectual property ends once and for all. And we will 
continue to stand strong until Beijing stops the predatory practice of 
forced technology transfer. We will protect the private property 
interests of American enterprise. (Applause.)
And to advance our vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, we’re 
building new and stronger bonds with nations that share our values 
across the region, from India to Samoa. Our relationships will flow from
 a spirit of respect built on partnership, not domination.
We’re forging new trade deals on a bilateral basis, just as last week
 President Trump signed an improved trade deal with South Korea. And we 
will soon begin historic negotiations for a bilateral free-trade deal 
with Japan. (Applause.)
I’m also pleased to report that we’re streamlining international 
development and finance programs. We’ll be giving foreign nations a just
 and transparent alternative to China’s debt-trap diplomacy. In fact, 
this week, President Trump will sign the BUILD Act into law.
Next month, it will be my privilege to represent the United States in
 Singapore and Papua New Guinea, at ASEAN and APEC. There, we will 
unveil new measures and programs to support a free and open 
Indo-Pacific. And on behalf of the President, I will deliver the message
 that America’s commitment to the Indo-Pacific has never been stronger. 
(Applause.)
Closer to home, to protect our interests, we’ve recently strengthened
 CFIUS — the Committee on Foreign Investment — heightening our scrutiny 
of Chinese investment in America to protect our national security from 
Beijing’s predatory actions.
And when it comes to Beijing’s malign influence and interference in 
American politics and policy, we will continue to expose it, no matter 
the form it takes. We will work with leaders at every level of society 
to defend our national interests and most cherished ideals. The American
 people will play the decisive role — and, in fact, they already are.
As we gather here, a new consensus is rising across America. More 
business leaders are thinking beyond the next quarter, and thinking 
twice before diving into the Chinese market if it means turning over 
their intellectual property or abetting Beijing’s oppression. But more 
must follow suit. For example, Google should immediately end development
 of the “Dragonfly” app that will strengthen Communist Party censorship 
and compromise the privacy of Chinese customers. (Applause.)
It’s also great to see more journalists reporting the truth without 
fear or favor, digging deep to find where China is interfering in our 
society, and why. And we hope that American and global news 
organizations will continue to join this effort on an increasing basis.
More scholars are also speaking out forcefully and defending academic
 freedom, and more universities and think tanks are mustering the 
courage to turn away Beijing’s easy money, recognizing that every dollar
 comes with a corresponding demand. And we’re confident that their ranks
 will grow.
And across the nation, the American people are growing in vigilance, 
with a newfound appreciation for our administration’s actions and the 
President’s leadership to reset America’s economic and strategic 
relationship with China. Americans stand strong behind a President 
that’s putting America first.
And under President Trump’s leadership, I can assure you, America 
will stay the course. China should know that the American people and 
their elected officials in both parties are resolved.
As our National Security Strategy states: We should remember that 
“Competition does not always mean hostility,” nor does it have to. The 
President has made clear, we want a constructive relationship with 
Beijing where our prosperity and security grow together, not apart. 
While Beijing has been moving further away from this vision, China’s 
rulers can still change course and return to the spirit of reform and 
opening that characterize the beginning of this relationship decades 
ago. The American people want nothing more; and the Chinese people 
deserve nothing less.
The great Chinese storyteller Lu Xun often lamented that his country,
 and he wrote, “has either looked down at foreigners as brutes, or up to
 them as saints,” but never “as equals.” Today, America is reaching out 
our hand to China. And we hope that soon, Beijing will reach back with 
deeds, not words, and with renewed respect for America. But be assured: 
we will not relent until our relationship with China is grounded in 
fairness, reciprocity, and respect for our sovereignty. (Applause.)
There is an ancient Chinese proverb that reads, “Men see only the 
present, but heaven sees the future.” As we go forward, let us pursue a 
future of peace and prosperity with resolve and faith. Faith in 
President Trump’s leadership and vision, and the relationship that he 
has forged with China’s president. Faith in the enduring friendship 
between the American people and the Chinese people. And Faith that 
heaven sees the future — and by God’s grace, America and China will meet
 that future together.
Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

近来，美国总统、副总统轮番上阵，在不同场合声称中国试图干预美国选举，对中国内外政策进行无端指责。10月6日，人民日报“钟声”栏目刊发评论，逐条予以驳斥，一起来看！
并不高明的造谣术
——评美国领导人诬蔑中国的种种奇谈怪论
　　近来，美国总统、副总统轮番上阵，在不同场合声称中国试图干预美国选举，对中国内外政策进行无端指责。美方的各种说法充斥着冷战思维和零和博弈的过时观念，不仅歪曲事实，还混淆是非，存在事实性、逻辑性和时代性错误。美方的奇谈怪论林林总总，归纳起来大概有这么几条：
　　谬论一：所谓中国内外政策方向出现偏差。这完全是无稽之谈。今年是中国改革开放40周年。40年来中国坚持深化改革、扩大开放，取得了巨大成就。中国已经找到了符合自身国情的中国特色社会主义道路，将继续坚定不移地沿着这条道路走下去。中国将会继续推进全面深化改革，对外开放的大门也只会越开越大。中国人民现在享受着前所未有的自由和权利，对此中国人自己最有发言权。与此同时，中国始终不渝走和平发展道路，致力于与各国发展友好合作关系，推进构建人类命运共同体。而美方戴着“有色眼镜”看中国，只会产生偏见甚至得出错误结论。
　　谬论二：所谓中国干预美国选举。这完全是子虚乌有。早在上世纪50年代，中国就提出了著名的“和平共处五项原则”，其中一条便是互不干涉内政。中国历来将此奉为金科玉律，坚持“己所不欲，勿施于人”。中国政府所想所做的都是让老百姓过上幸福的生活，我们已经够忙的了，根本没有兴趣也没有意图去操心美国的家务事。对于美方诬称中国干涉内政的言论，《纽约时报》、《华尔街日报》、美国有线电视新闻网、路透社等美国和国际媒体实在看不下去，直言美方的指控没有什么真凭实据。
　　谬论三：所谓中国媒体购买美国媒体版面影响舆论。这完全是牵强附会。事实上，中国有关媒体的做法根本不违反美国法律规定，许多其他国家的媒体也都是这么做的。美国人自己都承认这一点。美国布鲁金斯学会学者就刊文指出，中国媒体购买美国报纸版面的做法同其他国家相比并无特别之处，但美国领导人却把中国单挑出来。为什么这么做？显然是别有用心。
　　谬论四：所谓中国通过贸易反制打击特定选民。这完全是倒打一耙。中美经贸摩擦的是非曲直是清楚的。美方一手挑起贸易争端，一再对中国输美产品加征关税，既损人又害己。对此中方不得不作出反应，坚定捍卫自身合法权益，这属于“正当防卫”。在美方执意对华打贸易战的阴影下，美国的生产者、出口商和消费者，必然会受到贸易战的伤害。美国的大豆等农产品无辜“躺枪”，这与其产在共和党还是民主党选区丝毫没有关系。按照美方的“神逻辑”，那么现在对美国单边贸易行动采取反制的国家，包括美国盟友，都是在打击美国特定选民。美国难道要把干涉内政的帽子也扣在这些国家的头上吗？
　　谬论五：所谓中国对美发动网络攻击。这完全是臆测想象。中国是黑客攻击等网络威胁的主要受害国之一，也是网络安全的坚定维护者，一贯坚决反对并依法打击任何形式的网络攻击、窃密活动。人们不应忘记2013年的“棱镜门”事件，斯诺登公布的秘密文件显示，美国对全球各地的监听活动无所不在、无孔不入，甚至包括美国的盟友，就连德国总理默克尔也未能幸免。看来，美国不光在银幕上成功虚构了一个“黑客帝国”，也想在现实中制造一个。
　　谬论六：所谓中国“窃取”美国知识产权。这完全是罔顾事实。近二三十年来中国的知识产权保护事业不断进步。据世界知识产权组织报告显示，2017年中国已是国际专利申请第二大来源国。2001年中国对外支付知识产权使用费只有19亿美元，2017年已达到286亿美元。这说明中国尊重和保护知识产权的态度是认真的，行动是有效的。美方对此不能选择性无视。
　　谬论七：所谓中国与萨尔瓦多等国家建立外交关系威胁台海稳定。这完全是颠倒黑白。世界上只有一个中国，台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。早在数十年前，美国就承认一个中国原则，并在此政治基础上同中国建立了外交关系。数十年后，当其他主权国家在一个中国原则基础上同中国建交时，美方有何资格、有何权利对此指手画脚？！必须要看到，台海和平稳定面临的最大威胁始终是“台独”势力及其分裂行径。美方要做的是切实恪守一个中国原则和中美三个联合公报规定，同中方一道，约束和限制“台独”势力及其分裂行径，而不是一而再、再而三地向“台独”势力发出错误信号。
　　谬论八：所谓中国在南海搞“军事化”。这完全是指鹿为马。中国对南海诸岛及其附近海域拥有无可争辩的主权，这是我们的老祖宗留下来的。现在，中方在自己的岛礁上推进民事设施建设的同时，部署必要防御设施，这是国际法赋予主权国家的自保权和自卫权，根本不是“军事化”。但美方借口“航行和飞越自由”在地区加强军事部署，还一再派军舰军机抵近中方岛礁邻近海空域耀武扬威。到底是谁在南海搞“军事化”？到底是谁在南海挑事生非？到底是谁在南海制造紧张局势？这不是和尚头上的虱子——明摆着吗？同样，钓鱼岛及其附属岛屿是中国的固有领土，对中方舰船在钓鱼岛海域的正常巡航执法活动，美方也无权说三道四。
　　谬论九：所谓中国给一些发展中国家带来“债务陷阱”。这完全是挑拨离间。中国一贯秉承互利共赢精神同发展中国家开展经贸合作，同时奉行正确义利观，在力所能及的范围内提供援助，致力于提升有关国家的自主和可持续发展能力，受到了广泛欢迎。在不久前举行的2018年中非合作论坛北京峰会上，非洲各国领导人纷纷表示愿与中国实现互利共赢、共同发展。这些发自肺腑的心声和美国苍白无力的指控一对比，孰是孰非一目了然。美方应该摆正心态，不要对中国和其他发展中国家发展关系“羡慕嫉妒恨”，而应采取实际行动，争取成为发展中国家可以信任的合作伙伴。
　　事实胜于雄辩，也不容抹黑。但美方为何仍然要挖空心思地罗织“罪名”，把“干涉美国内政”等多个黑锅甩给中国呢？美国一些媒体和智库已经给出了答案：一是转移焦点。美国国内“通俄门”调查令一些人坐卧不安，于是就要多拉几个国家进来垫背，稀释调查的杀伤力，将水搅浑。二是抬升选情。即将于11月6日举行的中期选举是当前和下阶段美国国内政治的核心议题，美国政客所采取的一切行动都要服务于胜选目标，因此打“中国牌”、找“替罪羊”，就成了一些美国政客博取选票的手段。当然，如果败选了，那么也可以把失败的责任推卸给中国。三是对华加压。中美经贸战，美方久攻不下，“拳头打在中国长城的砖墙上”，只有提高调门、升级行动，逼迫中国屈服。可惜这将是枉费心机！
　　来而不往非礼也。针对美方无理发难，国务委员兼外交部长王毅在联合国安理会有关会议现场作出了有力的回应，指出中国历来坚持不干涉内政原则，我们过去、现在和将来都不会干涉任何国家的内政，呼吁其他国家也能恪守联合国宪章宗旨，不得干涉别国内政。中国外交部和驻美国使馆负责人已分别向美驻华使馆和国务院负责人提出严正交涉和抗议，敦促美方及时纠正错误，不要将中美关系引向对抗的道路。
　　那么，世界上究竟是哪个国家最热衷于干涉别国的内政呢？历史和现实最有说服力。美国在全球各地搞“和平演变”“颜色革命”，动辄对别国进行制裁打压，对国际法合则用、不合则弃，奉行“双重标准”，这些早已是罄竹难书。比如，美国一口咬定俄罗斯干预美2016年大选，而俄罗斯官方报告明确指出，美国在2011年至2017年间多次干预俄总统、国家杜马和地方选举。再比如，玻利维亚总统莫拉莱斯日前在联合国安理会仗义执言，历数美国从资助别国政变到军事干预的种种行径。公道自在人心！
　　美国在干涉中国内政方面更是劣迹斑斑。自新中国成立以来，美国从来就没有停止在台湾、涉藏、涉疆、人权等问题上插手干涉中国内政。美国口口声声奉行一个中国政策，但自中美《八·一七公报》签署以来，美国已80多次对台军售，累计金额高达520多亿美元。美国把武器出售给中国的一个省，这是对中国内政的最严重干涉。在涉藏问题上，美国将打着宗教幌子、长期从事分裂祖国活动的政治流亡者达赖奉为“座上宾”，美国国会还曾向其颁奖。这样的事不胜枚举，现在诬蔑中国是反咬一口！
　　坦率地讲，一段时间以来，美国国内不仅出现了“选举焦虑症”，也产生了严重的“对华焦虑症”，这两者叠加使中美关系处在了风口浪尖。越是这个关键时候，越需要双方着眼长远、深入思考、冷静决策。要看到，中美作为两个大国，双方谁也搞不垮谁，谁也改变不了谁，更重要的是，两国拥有广泛的共同利益，双方合作能够做成许多有利于两国和世界的好事。“合则两利，斗则俱伤”是对中美关系本质的最真实写照。美国政府和社会各界应该深思，冷战已经过去近30年了，美国真的想走历史的老路复制“麦卡锡主义”的闹剧吗？
　　“牢骚太盛防肠断，风物长宜放眼量。”中美关系的好坏在很大程度上决定着21世纪国际局势的走向，关系到人类的前途命运。中方始终致力于与美国共同秉持不冲突不对抗、相互尊重、合作共赢的理念，增进互信，扩大合作，管控分歧，维护中美关系的健康稳定发展。我们期待着美方同中方一道相向而行，而不是相反。
