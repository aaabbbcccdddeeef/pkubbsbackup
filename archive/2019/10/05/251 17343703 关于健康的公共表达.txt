摘一段twitter对话：
A: It seems that the mainland Chinese students are NOT intimidating the Hongkong protestors. The mainland Chinese students have their right to show their disagreement!
B: Many Chinese students are embarrassing not bc they show their disagreement, but precisely bc they can't articulate their disagreement. They can't make an argument for their case. Cursing &amp; singing national anthem is not an argument. In Arendtian sense it's not even speech.
