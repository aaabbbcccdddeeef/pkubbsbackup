法国数学家庞加莱的著作《科学的价值》于1913年由George Halsted翻译为英文，论述的主题就是“科学的价值”，其中也有几处漫不经心提及中国和东方文明，振聋发聩。我很难说的比庞加莱更好，因此希望在闲暇之时将这些文章陆续由英文翻译为中文，以供大家参考和交流。我想无需刻意强调，对大师的作品，每经一次翻译都丧失一份美感，从开始的法语途径英语再由我翻译为汉语，其中的美感估计会丧失大半。在这样的情况下，看法、英文是更好的选择，目前应该也有很多汉语译本了，我的翻译仅提供一种参考和理解。译文中的黑体字是我标注的，旨在指出我个人认为十分关键的内容。更新很可能是缓慢而不定时的。囿于个人水平和见识，必将有不少错译之处。之所以发在bbs上，是希望同学不吝指正，以使这个翻译更好。

The Choice of Facts
对事实的**选择 **
Tolstoi somewhere explains why ‘science for its own sake’ is in his eyes an absurd conception. We can not know all facts, since their number is practically infinite. It is necessary to choose; then we may let this choice depend on the pure caprice of our curiosity; would it not be better to let ourselves be guided by utility, by our practical and above all by our moral needs; have we nothing better to do than counting the number of lady-bugs on our planet?        
Tolstoi曾提到，“只为科学的科学”在他眼中是一种荒谬的想法。**我们无法知悉所有的事实，因为事实的数目是无法穷尽的。**因此，我们只能从事实中选择一些作为研究的对象；我们或许可以用好奇心作为选择的依据，又或者，可以按它们带来的效益从中优先选择，以尽可能满足我们的生活的和道德的需求。毕竟，总该有些事比统计地球上的瓢虫的数量更有意义吧？
It is clear the word utility has not for him the sense men of affairs give it, and following them most of our contemperaries. Little cares he for industrial applications, for the marvels of electricity or of automobiles, which he regards rather as obstacles to moral progress; utility for him is solely what can make man better.         
很显然，Tolstoi所说的“效益”，与那些务实之人和追随其后的大众所说的“效益”，含义并不相同。对工业上的应用他并不关心，无论是电力还是汽车所带来的奇迹，对他来说都不过是道德之路上的阻碍；“效益”这一词，对他而言，意指“让人们变得更好的事物”。
For my part, it need scarce be said, I could never be content with either one or the other ideal; I want neither that plutocracy grasping and mean, nor that democracy goody and mediocre, occupied solely in turning the other cheek, where would dwell sages without curiosity, who, shunning excess, would not die of disease, but would surely die of ennui. But that is a matter of taste and is not what I wish to discuss. 
对我而言，我对哪一种理想的极端都无法感到完全满意。我既不想要财阀政治一般的贪婪和吝啬，也不喜欢民主政治的伪善和平庸，这些人只知道一味容忍，最终不过变成了没有好奇心的圣人，他们事事都选择回避，不死于疾病也一定要无聊至死了。然而，这种选择是品味上的问题，在这里我不想讨论了。
The question nevertheless remains and should fix our attention; if our choice can only be determined by caprice or by immediate utility, there can be no science for its own sake, and consequently no science. But is that true? That a choice must be made is incontestable; whatever be our activity, facts go quicker than we, and we can not catch them; while the scientist discovers one fact, there happen milliards of milliards in a cubic millimeter of his body. To wish to comprise nature in science would be to want to put the whole into the part.         
然而到此为止，我们的问题还没有得到解决； 如果我们选取事实的方法只限于好奇心或者直接的效益这两者，那科学就不可能是为了自身的，因此也就不再有科学了（注：此处“科学”应指“只为科学的科学”或“纯科学”）。但我们真的没有科学吗？我们当然必须对事实做一个选择，这是无法否认的；无论我们的活动有多么迅速，事实都比我们更快，我们永远无法抓住他们全部；科学家发现一个事实的时候，在他体内的一角内又发生的事实是数不胜数的。想要将整个自然涵盖在科学中，就如同想要把整体放到部分中一般，是无法达到的。
But scientists believe there is a hierarchy of facts and that among them may be made a judicious choice. They are right, since otherwise there would be no science, yet science exists. One need only open the eyes to see that the conquests of industry which have enriched so many practical men would never have seen the light, if these practical men alone had existed and if they had not been preceded by unselfish devotees who died poor, who never thought of utility, and yet had a guide far other than caprice.         
但科学家仍相信事实是有高下之分的，在众多事实中，他们可以做一个明智的选择。当然有办法选择，否则，就不会有科学了，而科学今天确实是存在的。我们只需要睁开双眼就能看见，如果所有人都如工业界的那些人一般事事切合实际，那他们永远无法看到今天的光亮。在他们这些切合实际的人之前，有着许多无私奉献却死于贫穷的人，他们从未考虑过效益，而指导他们的，远远不是好奇心导致的一时兴起。
As Mach says, these devotees have spared their successors the trouble of thinking. Those who might have worked solely in view of an immediate application would have left nothing behind them, and in face of a new need, all must have been begun over again. Now most men do not love to think, and this is perhaps fortunate when instinct guides them, for most often, when they pursue an aim which is immediate and ever the same, instinct guides them better than reason would guide a pure intelligence. But instinct is routine, and if thought did not fecundate it, it would no more progress in man than in the bee or ant. It is needful then to think for those who love not thinking and, as they are numerous, it is needful that each of our thoughts be as often useful as possible, and this is why a law will be the more precious the more general it is.         
Mach说过这样一句话：就是这些无私奉献者让后人免去了思考的麻烦。那些完全为了直接应用而工作的人，不会为后人留下任何东西，一旦面对一个新的需求，一切又必须重新开始。其实，大多数人并不喜欢思考，不过这对于那些依靠本能的人而言可能是一种幸运。因为，当从事简单而重复性的劳动时，本能对人的指导远胜于理性对智力的指导。然而，本能是我们日常依赖的东西，如果思想没有使本能变得更丰蕴，人类的思考就不会发展到高于蜜蜂或是蚂蚁的程度。因此，我们需要为那些不愿思考的人去思考。因为不愿思考的人数量众多，所以我们需要让每一个想法都尽可能经常地有用，这就是为什么**越普遍的定律就越珍贵**（注：英译文中用词为“law”，意指法律、规则、自然定律）。
This shows us how we should choose: the most interesting facts are those which may serve many times; these are the facts which have a chance of coming up again. We have been so fortunate as to be born in a world where there are such. Suppose that instead of 60 chemical elements there were 60 milliards of them, that they were not, some common, the others rare, but that they were uniformly distributed. Then, every time we picked up a new pebble there would be great probability of its being formed of some unknown substance; all that we knew of other pebbles would be worthless for it; before each new object we should be as the new-born babe; like it we could only obey our caprices or our needs. Biologists would be just as much as a loss if there were only individuals and no species and if heredity did not make sons like their fathers. 
现在我们知道该如何选择事实了——我们应该选择那些经常用到的事实。最有趣的事实，是那些可能会再次出现的事实。我们是幸运的，生活在一个有这样的事实的世界中。设想，如果世界不是由60种化学元素构成，而是由60亿万种化学元素构成，再假设这些元素的出现是等可能的。在这样的世界中，每当我们拿起一个石子，它在几率上都由新的物质构成；因此，我们对其他石子的知识，对手中的石子将会是完全无用的；在每一个新的物体前，我们都会像婴儿一样；正是因为像婴儿一样，我们唯一可以依赖的就是我们的意愿和需求了。这种迷茫，就好比一个生物学家到了一个只有个体却没有物种、子代不遗传父辈性状的世界一样。
In such a world there would be no science; perhaps thought and even life would be impossible, since evolution could not there develop the preservational instincts. Happily it is not so; like all good fortune to which we are accustomed, this is not appreciated at its true worth.
在这样的世界中，将不会再有科学。或许，就连生命也是不可能的了，因为演化在那里无法发展出自我保留的本能。还好，世界不是这样；对于惯以为常的好运，我们久处其中就不能欣赏它的价值，因此我们今天很难感受出这种好运的真正价值。
Which then are the facts likely to reappear? They are first the simple facts. It is clear that in a complex fact a thousand circumstances are united by chance, and that only a chance still much less probable could reunite them anew. But are there any simple facts? And if there are, how recognize them? What assurance is there that a thing we think simple does not hide a dreadful complexity? All we can say is that we ought to prefer the facts which seem simple to those where our crude eye discerns unlike elements. And then one of two things: either this simplicity is real, or else the elements are so intimately mingled as not to be distinguishable. In the first case there is chance of our meeting anew this same simple fact, either in all its purity or entering itself as element in a complex manifold. In the second case this intimate mixture has likewise more chances of recurring than a heterogeneous assemblage; chance knows how to mix, it knows not how to disentangle, and to make with multiple elements a well-ordered edifice in which something is distinguishable, it must be made expressly. The facts which appear simple, even if they are not so, will therefore be more easily revived by chance. This it is which justifies the method instinctively adopted by the scientist, and what justifies it still better, perhaps, is that oft-recurring facts appear to us simple, precisely because we are used to them. 
哪些事实更可能反复出现呢？首先，是简单的事实。因为，一个复合的事实，通常是因上千种环境的巧合形成的，单单因为巧合就再次形成同样的复合的几率是非常小的。真的有简单的事实吗？如果有的话，要怎么辨别它们？怎么确保我们所以为的简单，背后没有隐藏着极大的复杂性呢？对此，我们唯一的方法就是：选择那些我们肉眼看起来更简单的事实，而不是那些看起来根本不像基元的事实（英译文“Elements”，意为“元素，其他事物的组成部分”）。因此对于简单的事实，只有两种可能：要么我们所见的简单性是真实的，要么这简单性的构成基元已如此亲密地混杂，以至于我们已经无法分辨。在第一种情形下，我们可能会再次遇到这个事实，它或以纯粹的形式出现，或作为一个复杂复合体中的组成基元出现。在第二种情形下，简单事实的组成部分混合地已经如此紧密，以至于无法将这些组成部分分离，因此他们也有更大的共同出现的可能性；几率他懂得如何混合，却不知道如何分开，如果多个基元已能形成一个秩序森然而足以辨认的结构，那么这个结构的形成必定是刻意的。因此，我们看起来简单的事实，即使事实上是复合形成的，也更容易被几率重新唤起。以上的论述可以解释科学家们凭本能采用的选取事实的方法。或许，还有一个更好的解释——那些反复出现的事实之所以看起来简单，其实恰巧是因为我们已经习惯了。
But where is the simple fact? Scientists have been seeking it in the two extremes, in the infinitely great and in the infinitely small. The astronomer has found it because the distances of the stars are immense, so great that each of them appears but as a point, so great that the qualitative differences are effaced, and because a point is simpler than a body which has form and qualities. The physicist, on the other hand, has sought the elementary phenomenon in fictively cutting up bodies into infinitesimal cubes, because the conditions of the problem, which undergo slow and continuous variation in passing from one point of the body to another, may be regarded as constant in the interior of each of these little cubes. In the same way the biologist has been instinctively led to regard the cell as more interesting than the whole animal, and the outcome has shown his wisdom, since cells belonging to organisms the most different are more alike, for the one who can recognize their resemblances, than are these organisms themselves. The sociologists are more embarrassed; the elements, which for him are men, are too unlike, too variable, too capricious in a word, too complex; besides, history never begins over again. How then choose the interesting fact, which is that which begins again? Method is precisely the choice of facts; it is needful then to be occupied first with creating a method, and many have been imagined, since none imposes itself, so that sociology is the science which has the most methods and the fewest results. 
在哪里寻找这些简单事实呢？**科学家们在两个极端中找寻事实——在至大和至小之中。**天文学家之所以找到了简单事实，是因为星体之间的距离是如此的浩瀚，在这极大尺度下星体看起来几乎成了一点，因此他们各自特性的影响被去除了，物体的形态和性质造成的复杂性也被隐去了。物理学家通过想象将空间分割成很多个无穷小方块，在这至小的层次上寻找简单现象，这是因为物理学所研究的问题满足这个条件：从物体的一点移动到另一点时，条件的变化是缓慢而连续的，因此在每一个无限小块的内部都可看作常数。生物学家也本能地将细胞看作比整只动物更有意思的研究对象，而结果已经证实了他的智慧——对于那些认识到细胞之间的相似性的人而言，即便看起来很不相同的生物也有着较相似的细胞。社会学家的处境是最尴尬的，他所研究的基元是人类，而人之间的差别太大、太多变、太难以预测，总而言之，人太复杂；另外，历史从来不会真正地重演。在这种情况下，要怎么选择事实，如何确定现象的重复单元为何，以及这些单元开始在哪里呢？方法，其实就是对事实的选择，在研究开始前需要先确立一个方法。到目前为止，社会学家已经想象了许多方法，却还没有一个方法能得到确定的地位。因此在所有科学中，社会学有最多的方法，却有着最少的结论。
        
Therefore it is by the regular facts that it is proper to begin. But after the rule is well established, after it is beyond all doubt, the facts in full conformity with it are ere long without interest since they no longer teach us anything new. It is then the exception which becomes important. We cease to seek resemblances; we devote ourselves above all to the differences, and among the differences are chosen first the most accentuated, not only because they are the most striking, but because they will be the most instructive. A simple example will make my thought plainer: Suppose one wishes to determine a curve by observing some of its points. The practician who concerns himself only with immediate utility would observe only the points he might need for some special object. These points would be badly distributed on the curve; they would be crowded in certain regions, rare in others, so that it would be impossible to join them by a continuous line, and they would be unavailable for other applications. The scientist will proceed differently; as he wishes to study the curve for itself, he will distribute regularly the points to be observed, and when enough are known he will join them by a regular line and then he will have the entire curve. But for that how does he proceed? If he has determined an extreme point of the curve, he does not stay near this extremity, but goes first to the other end; after the two extremities the most instructive point will be the mid-point and so on. 
因此，我们要首先选择的是那些寻常的事实。此后通过这些事实确立了法则并保证了可信性后，那些与法则相吻合的事实，就失去了重要性；因为，我们从这些事实中无法再了解新的信息了。这时，违反规则的例外反而变得重要了。我们不再寻找相似性，而开始寻找差异性，我们要选择的是那些最醒目的差异，不仅是因为这些事实最让人惊讶，更是因为它们是最具指导性的。一个简单的例子更能说明我的想法：假设一个人想通过描点将一条曲线画出来。那些只在乎眼前效益的实践者，只会观测他为了达成特殊目的所需要的点。他画下的点在曲线上的分布将是丑陋的；在一些区域很密，有些区域却太稀少，很难将这些点连成一条连续的线，因而他们所描的图无法用于其他应用。科学家则会采取一种不同的手段，因为他的目的是研究曲线本身。他会尽可能均匀地将观测点分布在整条曲线上，当观测点足够多的时候，他就可以把它们连成一条连续的线了。这样，他就得到了整条曲线。具体要怎么做呢？他先观测一个端点，但他并不停留在这个端点附近，下次他就会观测另一端的端点；两个端点都观测后他会观察中点，然后继续这样进行下去。
So when a rule is established we should first seek the cause where this rule has the greatest chance of failing. Thence, among other reasons, come the interest of astronomic facts and the interest of the geologic past; by going very far away in space or very far away in time, we may find out usual rules entirely overturned, and these grand overturnings aid us the better to see or the better to understand the little changes which may happen nearer to us, in the little corner of the world where we are called to live and act. We shall better know this corner for having traveled in distant countries with which we have nothing to do. 
所以当一个规则被确立下来之后，我们应该检验的是，这个规则在何时最可能失效。这正是科学家对天文事实和地质历史产生兴趣的原因之一；我们在空间和时间上走到极远的地方，就是希望在那里我们的规则会被完全颠覆。正是这些大的颠覆，让我们对自己栖身的一角有了更敏感的观察和更深刻的认识。正因为我们遨游于乌有之乡与广漠之野，我们更了解我们偏安的一隅了。
But what we ought to aim at is less the ascertainment of resemblances and differences than the recognition of likenesses hidden under apparent divergences. Particular rules seem at first discordant, but looking more closely we see in general that they resemble each other; different as to matter, they are alike as to form, as to the order of their parts. When we look at them with this bias, we shall see them enlarge and tend to embrace everything. And this it is which makes the value of certain facts which come to complete an assemblage and to show that it is the faithful image of other known assemblages. 
然而，这种相似与差异的分辨并不是终极的目标，**我们找寻的是藏匿于表面分歧之下的内在相似性**。各个规则在最初看起来不甚和谐，但仔细思索，我们将发现它们大同小异；组成的实质不同，它们的形式与内部秩序却可能相似。当我们带着这种倾向考虑那些规则时，它们就会不断扩大，直至最后包揽万物。这样，我们才认清那些特定事实的价值；一些事实相互组装形成复合结构，让我们认清，它们不过是之前已知的复合结构的忠实镜像而已。
I will not further insist, but these few words suffice to show that the scientist does not choose at random the facts he observes. He does not, as Tolstoi says, count the lady-bugs, because, however interesting lady-bugs may be, their number is subject to capricious variations. He seeks to condense much experience and much thought into a slender volume; and that is why a little book on physics contains so many past experiences and a thousand times as many possible experiences whose result is known beforehand. 
对于科学家选择事实的方法的探讨，到此告一段落。我们应该已经说明了，科学家并不是随意地选择事实。科学家们并不像Tolstoi说的那样，每天只做统计瓢虫数量这类的琐事；因为，不论瓢虫多么有趣，它们的数量变化都是缺乏规律的。**科学家所做的事情，是将大量的经验与思考凝聚成一小册书**；这就是为什么一本精巧的物理书可以告诉我们如此多的经验，它解释了过去观测到结果的经验，更包含了无数个未曾观测过结果的经验。
But we have as yet looked only one side of the question. The scientist does not study nature because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it, and he delights in it because it is beautiful. If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth knowing, and if nature were not worth knowing, life would not be worth living. Of course I do not here speak of that beauty which strikes the sense, the beauty of qualities and of appearances; not that I undervalue such beauty, far from it, but it has nothing to do with science; I mean that profounder beauty which comes from the harmonious order of the parts and which a pure intelligence can grasp. This it is which gives body, a structure so to speak, to the iridescent appearances which flatter our senses, and without this support the beauty of these fugitive dreams would be only imperfect, because it would be vague and always fleeting. On the contrary, intellectual beauty is sufficient unto itself, and it is for its sake, more perhaps than for the future good of humanity, that the scientist devotes himself to long and difficult labors. 
但是，我们也只看到了问题的一面。**科学家之所以研习自然，并非因它有用；他之所以研习自然，是因为自然让他感到喜悦；他喜悦，是因为独有自然是至美的。如果自然不美，那它就不值得认识。如果自然不值得认识，那生命就不值得珍视。**当然，我这里提到的美，并非指那些打动感官的美，或是那些出于性质和表象的美。如果说我轻视这种美，那就大相径庭；不过，这种美确与科学无关。我所说的美，是一种更深的美，它来自于各部件之间的和谐秩序，这种美单用智力就可感知。正是这种智力的美感，赋予了肢体某种结构，使其表象令人心驰神往；若没有了它的支撑，这种转瞬即逝的梦境就会沾染瑕疵，变得飘忽不定。与那种表象美不同，智力的美感对自身就已充足；**科学家之所以殚精竭虑探知自然，其首要追求，在于这种智力上的美感，而不甚在于人类的美好未来。**
It is, therefore, the quest of this especial beauty, the sense of the harmony of the cosmos, which makes us choose the facts most fitting to contribute to this harmony, just as the artist chooses from among the features of his model those which perfect the picture and give it character and life. And we need not fear that this instinctive and unavowed prepossession will turn the scientist aside from the search for the true. One may dream a harmonious world, but how far the real world will leave it behind! The greatest artists that ever lived, the Greeks, made their heavens; how shabby it is beside the true heavens, ours!
因此，这种对美的追求，对宇宙的和谐感的追求，让我们选择了那些与宇宙的和谐感最贴切的事实，这正如艺术家只从他的模型中选取那些让作品更富特性与生命的特征。的确，科学家所依赖的，是这种隐含于本能的对美的执著，但我们无需担心这种执著会使科学家偏离真相。即便是你所能想象的最和谐的世界，于真实世界也只会相形见绌！希腊人是历史上最伟大的艺术家，他们曾建造天堂；然而，与我们所知的天堂相比，他们的天堂又是何其陋败！
And it is because simplicity, because grandeur, is beautiful, that we preferably seek simple facts, sublime facts, that we delight now to follow the majestic course of the stars, now to examine with the microscope that prodigious littleness which is also a grandeur, now to seek in geologic time the traces of a past which attracts because it is far away. 
**正因为那至简的和至大的必是至美的，我们偏爱简单和宏大的事实。**我们醉心于追随群星的至伟的行进，我们用显微镜探查那至大的至小，我们在地质时间中追寻往去的痕迹，不正因我们被它的寥远所吸引吗？
We see too that the longing for the beautiful leads us to the same choice as the longing for the useful. And so it is that this economy of thought, this economy of efforts, which is according to Mach, the constant tendency of science, is at the same time a source of beauty and a practical advantage. The edifices that we admire are those where the architect has known how to proportion the means to the end, where the columns seem to carry gaily, without effort, the weight placed upon them, like the gracious caryatids of the Erechtheion. 
我们看到，对美的渴望与对效用的渴望常常将我们引向同样的选择。而且，也就是这种思想上的节约，这种劳力的节约，这些Mach所说的科学的不变倾向，是美的来源和实际的优势。最值得欣赏的建筑，就是那些建造者巧妙地将手段用于需求的建筑，它的立柱几乎不费力气就能支撑起头顶的重量，就如同Erechtheion神殿的像柱一般。
Whence comes this concordance? Is it simply that the things which seem to us beautiful are those which best adapt themselves to our intelligence, and that consequently they are at the same time the implement this intelligence knows best how to use? Or is there here a play of evolution and natural selection? Have the peoples whose ideal most conformed to their highest interest exterminated the others and taken their place? All pursued their ideals without reference to consequences, but while this quest led some to destruction, to others it gave empire. One is tempted to believe it. If the Greeks triumphed over the barbarians and if Europe, heir of Greek thought, dominates the world, it is because the savages loved loud colors and the clamorous tones of the drum which occupied only their senses, while the Greeks loved the intellectual beauty which hides beneath sensuous beauty, and that this intellectual beauty it is which makes intelligence sure and strong. 
美与效用的一致性从何而来呢？是否因为，在我们看来美的事物也正是那些与我们的智能最相宜的事物，也因此最容易被我们的智能运用？演化和自然选择是否起了作用？是不是因为，那些理想与最高需求吻合得最好的人，将其他人消灭而取而代之呢？**所有人都不顾后果地追逐他们的理想，这给一些人带来了灭亡，却给另一些人带来了帝国。**或许的确是这样。希腊人征服了蛮夷，而继承了希腊思想的欧洲人今天征服了世界，正是因为那些原始人热爱的是充斥感官的喧声与艳色，而**希腊人热爱的是隐藏在感官美之下的智力美**，就是这种智力美确保了智能的可信和有力。
Doubtless such a triumph would horrify Tolstoi, and he would not like to acknowledge that it might be truly useful. But this disinterested quest of the true for its own beauty is sane also and able to make man better. I well know there are mistakes, that the thinker does not always draw thence the serenity he should find therein, and even that there are scientists of bad character. Must we, therefore, abandon science and study only morals? What! Do you think the moralists themselves are irreproachable when they come down from their pedestal? 
无疑，这种胜利对Tolstoi而言会是一种惊吓，而他当然不愿承认这种胜利可能确有用处。但是，这种不求私利的对真理之美的追求，也的确是理智的，而且它也的确会让人变得更好。我当然知道，思考者有时并不能从他的思考中获得他本应找到的平静，甚至某些科学家的品性还很恶劣。那么，我们是不是只能抛弃科学而研究道德呢？什么！难道你以为那些道德说教者在走下神坛后，仍是无可指摘的吗？

Introduction
引言
（更新于10.21, 未完）
The search for truth should be the goal of our activities; it is the sole end worthy of them. Doubtless we should first bend our efforts to assuage human suffering, but why? Not to suffer is a negative ideal more surely attained by the annihilation of the world. If we wish more and more to free man from material cares, it is that he may be able to employ the liberty obtained in the study and contemplation of truth. 
对真理的追寻，应是我们生存的唯一目的；唯有它，有如此价值。无疑，我们应该首先把精力倾注在减少人类的苦难上，但为什么？如果只是为了减少痛苦，那直接毁灭整个世界难道不是更易达到这种否定式的理想吗？我们之所以希望人们从物质上的忧虑中解放出来，是因为唯有如此，他才能取得自由以用于对真理的研习和思考。
But sometimes truths frightens us. And in fact we know that it is sometimes deceptive, that it is phantom never showing itself for a moment except to ceaselessly flee, that it must be pursued further and ever further without ever being attained. Yet to work one must stop, as some Greek, Aristotle or another, has said. We also know how cruel the truth often is, and we wonder whether illusion is not more consoling, yea, even more bracing, for illusion it is which gives confidence. When it shall have vanished, will hope remain and shall we have the courage to achieve? Thus would the horse harnessed to his treadmill refuse to go, were his eyes not bandaged? And then to seek truth it is necessary to be independent, wholly independent. If on the contrary we wish to act, to be strong, we should be united. This is why many of us fear truth; we consider it a cause of weakness. Yet truth should not be feared, for it alone is beautiful. 
然而，真理常常让人感到恐惧。我们知道，真理常是欺骗性的——它是一个幽灵，在显现的一瞬间就又开始逃离，我们对它必须一刻也不停地追寻，却永远也不能将它捕获。然而，Aristotle或某个希腊人却这样说：“为了工作，我们必须停留”。我们也知道，真理通常是残忍的，错觉反而可能更让人心安；反而错觉更振奋人心，因为正是错觉给了我们自信。如果没有了这种自信，我们真的还能保留任何希望吗？我们还会有勇气去实现这些希望吗？试想，如果马的眼睛没有被蒙上，那他还会继续推动他的踏车吗？为了追寻真理，人必须独立，必须达到完全的独立。然而，如果我们要行动、要变得强大，就必须联合在一起。这就是为什么如此多的人恐惧真理；因为我们把真理看作虚弱的来源。然而，我们不应恐惧真理，只因唯有真理是美的。
When I speak here of truth, assuredly I refer first to scientific truth; but I also mean moral truth, of which what we call justice is only one aspect. It may seem that I am misusing words, that I combine thus under the same name two things having nothing in common; That scientific truth, which is demonstrated, can in no way be likened to moral truth, which is felt. And yet I can not separate them, and whosoever loves the one can not help loving the other. To find the one, as well as to find the other, it is necessary to free the soul completely from prejudice and from passion; it is necessary to attain absolute sincerity. These two sorts of truth when discovered give the same joy; each when perceived beams with the same splendor, so that we must see it or close our eyes. Lastly, both attract us and flee from us; they are never fixed: when we think to have reached them, we find that we have still to advance, and he who pursues them is condemned never to know repose. It must be added that those who fear the one will also fear the other; for they are the ones who in everything are concerned above all with consequences. In a word, I liken the two truths, because the same reasons makes us love them and because the.same reasons makes us love them and because the same reasons make us fear them. 
我提到真理时，当然首先是指科学真理；但我说的“真理”一词也包含着道德真理，而我们称作正义的仅是其中的一部分。我看似在错用词语：我用同一个名字称呼了两种迥异的事物。科学真理需要证实，而道德真理则需要感受。但我却无法区分这两者，而爱其中一种的也会无法避免地爱上另一种。不论要找寻其中哪一种真理，都必须先将灵魂从偏见和激情中彻底解脱，都必须先达到完全真诚。这两种真理，在被发现时，给人以同样的愉悦；在被感知时，闪耀着同样的辉煌，我们若是不愿看见，就只好闭上双眼。两者同样吸引着我们，又同样从我们身边逃离；他们从不止步：每当我们以为抓住真理时，我们都会发现还仍需前进——那些追寻真理的人注定无法停歇。我还要指出，畏惧一种真理的也会畏惧另一种；因为对真理的追寻必是不顾一切的，更是不计后果的。总之，我之所以将这两者一并称呼，是因为人们出于同样的原因爱着它们，也出于同样的原因而恐惧它们。
