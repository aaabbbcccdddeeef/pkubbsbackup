昨天发现pku邮箱垃圾箱里有两封勒索邮件，发件人显示都是我自己。邮件中提到的日期好像不太对，一封是March 06 另一封是 Oct 08.
想问一下老师这是什么情况？ 是伪造的信头还是密码泄露了？
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello!
I have very bad news for you. October 08, 2019 - on this day I hacked your OS and got full access to your account: *******@pku.edu.cn. You can check it - I sent this message from your account.
So, you can change the password, yes.. But my malware intercepts it every time.
How I made it: In the software of the router, through which you went online, was a vulnerability. I just hacked this router and placed my malicious code on it. When you went online, my trojan was installed on the OS of your device.
After that, I made a full dump of your disk (I have all your address book, history of viewing sites, all files, phone numbers and addresses of all your contacts).
A month ago, I wanted to lock your device and ask for a not big amount of btc to unlock. But I looked at the sites that you regularly visit, and I was shocked by what I saw!!! I'm talk you about sites for adults.
I want to say - you are a BIG pervert. Your fantasy is shifted far away from the normal course!
And I got an idea.... I made a screenshot of the adult sites where you have fun (do you understand what it is about, huh?). After that, I made a screenshot of your joys (using the camera of your device) and glued them together. Turned out amazing! You are so spectacular!
I'm know that you would not like to show these screenshots to your friends, relatives or colleagues. I think $995 is a very, very small amount for my silence. Besides, I have been spying on you for so long, having spent a lot of time!
Pay ONLY in Bitcoins! My BTC wallet: 1CemrDkdcYsmNUNgqD97P8A5SBDbHZRvys
You do not know how to use bitcoins? Enter a query in any search engine: "how to replenish btc wallet". It's extremely easy
For this payment I give you two days (48 hours). As soon as this letter is opened, the timer will work.
After payment, my virus and dirty screenshots with your enjoys will be self-destruct automatically. If I do not receive from you the specified amount, then your device will be locked, and all your contacts will receive a screenshots with your "enjoys".
I hope you understand your situation.
&gt;&gt; Do not try to find and destroy my virus! (All your data, files and screenshots is already uploaded to a remote server)
&gt;&gt; Do not try to contact me (you yourself will see that this is impossible, I sent you an email from your account)
&gt;&gt; Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help, since your data is already on a remote server.
P.S. You are not my single victim. so, I guarantee you that I will not disturb you again after payment! This is the word of honor hacker.
I also ask you to regularly update your antiviruses in the future. This way you will no longer fall into a similar situation.
Do not hold evil! I just do my job. Good luck.

你好！一般都是伪造的信头。你可以登录mail.pku.edu.cn的web版，在左侧蓝条第五个按钮应用中心里，选自助查询、发信查询，如果是你的账号发送的邮件，这里面都会列出来。

谢谢老师！
我看了一下不是自己发的。但登录记录里显示最近几个月有上千次来自SMTP的密码错误的失败登录，该怎么样预防这种攻击呢...

你好！密码错误表明尝试登录的行为没有成功。我们的邮件系统对这种攻击有一定的防护能力，密码错误7次，对方地址会被封禁10分钟。封禁期间，如果对方继续尝试登录，会被系统直接拒绝，但登录次数会被累计下来。除了前7次，后面的实际上已经被拒绝了，没有真的生效。
在its.pku.edu.cn的“设置邮件”里有一个“不使用客户端、只使用浏览器访问邮箱”的功能，设置之后用户只能通过web方式收发邮件，imap、pop3都被禁止了，尝试猜测密码的一方，不论发送的密码是否正确，都会收到一个失败的提示。这个方法可以使猜测密码的行为完全失效，但是用户不能使用常用的客户端收发邮件，也会有很大的不便，可以根据自己的情况选择使用。
