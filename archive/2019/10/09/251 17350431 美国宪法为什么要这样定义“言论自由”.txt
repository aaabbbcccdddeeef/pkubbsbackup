美国宪法为什么要这样定义“言论自由”

美国宪法第一修正案原文：
<u>Congress shall make no law </u>respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
第一修正案（Amendment I）<u>禁止美国国会制订任何法律以</u>确立国教；妨碍宗教自由；剥夺言论自由；侵犯新闻自由与集会自由；干扰或禁止向政府请愿的权利。

解释：
The First Amendment's constitutional right of free speech, which is applicable to state and local governments under the incorporation doctrine, <u>only prevents government restrictions on speech, not restrictions imposed by private individuals or businesses unless they are acting on behalf of the government. </u>
