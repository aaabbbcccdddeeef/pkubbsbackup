Prominent Christian pastors and worship leaders prayed over President Trump in the Oval Office last week, as he told them he needs prayer now more than ever amid the intensifying impeachment probe on Capitol Hill.
About 50 worship leaders from across America gathered for a faith briefing Friday organized by Paula White-Cain, the president's personal pastor and special adviser to the Faith and Opportunity Initiative in the White House.
"All 50 of us crammed into the Oval Office. He sat at his desk and he said pray for me," Sean Feucht, a Bethel Music worship leader who is running for Congress in California's Third Congressional District, told Fox News.
