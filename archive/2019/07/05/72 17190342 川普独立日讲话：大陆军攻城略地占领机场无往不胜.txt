讲话原文：
In June of 1775 the Continental Congress created a unified Army out of the Revolutionary Forces encamped around Boston and New York, and named after the great George Washington, commander in chief. The Continental Army suffered a bitter winter of Valley Forge, found glory across the waters of the Delaware and seized victory from Cornwallis at Yorktown. **Our Army manned the air, it rammed the ramparts, **<font color="#c00000">**it took over airports**</font>**, it did everything it had to do** and at Ft. McHenry under the rocket’s red glare had nothing but victory. When dawn came, the star-spangled banner waved defiant.
原来打独立战争的时候就有机场了吗
