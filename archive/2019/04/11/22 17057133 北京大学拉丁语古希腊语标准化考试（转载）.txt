北京大学拉丁语/古希腊语标准化考试
PKU STANDARDISED TESTS: LATIN AND ANCIENT GREEK
 
北京大学初级和中级拉丁语和古希腊语标准化考试（2019年5月）
PKU STANDARDISED TESTS: LATIN AND GREEK ON ELEMENTARY AND INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (May 2019)
 
2017年9月，北京大学西方古典学中心成功举办了汉语学界第一次初级拉丁语标准化考试。次年5月，又同时举办了第二次初级拉丁语和第一次初级古希腊语考试。举办这一考试，是因为我们坚信掌握拉丁语和古希腊语是学习和研究西方古代和中世纪历史、文学和哲学的基础，而标准化的语言考试可以让我们能够更好地评估和巩固这一基础。在过去两次考试的基础上，北京大学西方古典学中心将于2019年5月推出初级和中级拉丁语和古希腊语标准化考试，并欢迎港澳台地区在内的全国高校学生和青年学者报名参加。初级和中级拉丁语标准考试将于5月11日（周六）举办（初级和中级考试时间一致），初级和中级古希腊语标准考试将于5月12日（周日）举办（初级和中级考试时间一致）。具体时间和场所将另行通知。北京大学拉丁语和古希腊语标准考试目前不收取报名费；参加考试所需要的交通和食宿费用由考生自理。北京大学西方古典学中心将给考生邮寄成绩，北京考生也可前来我中心自取。
 
Since September 2017 the Centre for Classical and Medieval Studies at Peking University has been offering standardised tests in Elementary Latin, Intermediate Latin and Elementary Greek. Behind this move was a firm belief that the promotion of Latin and Ancient Greek among students in ancient and medieval literature, history and philosophy would be best served by the creation of a standard for assessing proficiency in those two classical languages. Eager to continue on this path, we are pleased to announce tests in Elementary and Intermediate Latin and Greek taking place in May of 2019 at Peking University. The tests are open to students and young scholars from universities across China, including those in Taiwan and the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macao. The tests in Elementary and Intermediate Latin are scheduled to take place on Saturday the 11th of May (both at the same time). The tests in Elementary and Intermediate Greek are scheduled for Sunday the 12th of May (both taking place at the same time). Further details regarding the tests will be sent to those who register their participation through email.
 
The Centre for Classical and Medieval Studies at Peking University will inform participants of their test results by letter.
