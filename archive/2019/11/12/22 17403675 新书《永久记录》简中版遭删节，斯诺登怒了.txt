爱德华·斯诺登新书《永久记录：美国政府监控全世界网络的真相》在九月出版（[https://book.douban.com/subject/34782540/](jump-to.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbook.douban.com%2Fsubject%2F34782540%2F)）后，将于本月由民主与建设出版社出版简体中文译版（[https://book.douban.com/subject/34862375/](jump-to.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbook.douban.com%2Fsubject%2F34862375%2F)）。简中版两位译者萧美惠与郑胜得与先前出版的台版《永久檔案》（[https://book.douban.com/subject/34808222/](jump-to.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbook.douban.com%2Fsubject%2F34808222%2F)）所署的译者名字相同，推断应该是直接基于台版译稿编辑完成。
今天斯诺登本人发现，简中版书稿中出现了多处删节情况，他说这违反了之前的出版合同，因而号召抵制（[https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1194092273170038784](jump-to.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FSnowden%2Fstatus%2F1194092273170038784)）。他呼吁网友一起来做校勘，补全被删节的段落：
The Chinese edition of my new book, #PermanentRecord, has just been censored. This violates the publishing agreement, so I'm going to resist it the way I know best: it's time to blow the whistle. You can help. Here's how:
I asked to see a copy of censored passages, and was given a list of a few of the worst examples. I'm going to post them right here on Twitter, and we're going to translate them and expose exactly what the censors were trying to hide. Let's use Twitter for something good.
Let us compile a correct and unabridged version of #PermanentRecord to publish freely online in Chinese, by assembling a cadre of translators to expose every shameful redaction the censors demanded. We will work in service to the greater Republic of Letters and a better internet.
If you can read simplified Chinese and another language Permanent Record has been translated into (or know someone who does), tag them on this thread and see if they can help restore the missing passages to the Chinese edition.
（举了若干书稿中被删节的例子）
There are probably other changes we won't know about until we can get a hardcopy of the simplified edition up online, but let's start correcting the corrections. Thank you so much for helping Chinese readers!
This has been a long day. It's past 7AM here and I haven't slept yet, so I'm going to crash, but I look forward to the responses. Let's do something good for the world.  谢谢你，加油!
And before anyone asks, I will make exactly zero dollars from the Chinese edition of the book (because of the US government lawsuit), but that's alright: I didn't write this book for money.
他甚至还用简体字发推：

这个书能在国内出版才是让人比较惊奇的事情.jpg
涉外选题，大概是靠着“美国政府监控全世界网络的真相”这个吸睛副标题才拿到的书号吧2333

还诚实的标注出来“此章节标记处有删减”，会玩
