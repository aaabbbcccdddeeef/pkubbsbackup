Hello, 
It sounds to me that something has happened that makes you feel overwhelmed and unable to resolve. While you still try to think of people around you.. Would you like to elaborate on what happened? Maybe you can make yourself feel better with the help of your friends' or people who know you with their comfort or some advice.
Because you keep mentioning "other people" in your text. These people seem to be people you value. You want to be responsible for them, and you want to stop bothering them. Maybe they value you and actually would like to help you.
If you feel bad, please feel free to call the 24-hour psychological crisis assistance hotline of the Peking University at 010-62760521 or 010-61943712. When your mood improves, you may be able to think of more possibilities to solve the problem. We are willing to be your companions. Come on and good luck!
