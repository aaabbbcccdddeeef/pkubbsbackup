有个在英国读书的好朋友想来咱北大报考燕京学堂literature方向研究生，她主要是想做学术研究，但是不清楚咱们的燕京学堂研究生具体学习内容是偏向给留学生拓展视野的类型，还是搞研究的类型。官网上看课程不多，也没有太详细的资料，想实地考察，但是迫于疫情期间封校，外面的人限制进入，也不好问到。所以她留了几个问题，想请了解具体情况，不知有没有知情同学能介绍一下或留个联系方式可以让她交流交流^__^
Questions:
Do I need to take a chinese exam before I get there?
What is the proportion of time spent on learning Chinese language?
What is the proportion of time spent on the thesis?
What is the word limit of the thesis?
Could you send some previous Chinese or comparative literature theses examples, topics, or outlines to yuchen.z@btinternet.com
What are the library facilities like? Especially English libraries.
Tell me a bit more about how the guided reading of Chinese literature works? Is it done in classes, what is the class size, and how much opportunity is there for one to one teaching?
Term dates/holidays?
借贵版宝地问一下试试看：P
