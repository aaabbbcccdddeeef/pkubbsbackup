在奥斯维辛之后写诗是野蛮的吗？

【摘要】
网传《长江日报》最近发表评论《相比 “风月同天”，我更想听到 “武汉加油”》[1]，其中不给出处地引用了一句 “奥斯维辛之后，写诗是残忍的”。经检索，此言出处几乎全部指向德国哲学家西奥多·阿多诺 (T. W. Adorno). 值得注意的是，**这是一个违背作者原意的引文错误，属于典型的断章取义**。为资辨析，这里择要翻译波士顿大学历史，哲学和政治学教授 J. Schimdt 2013 年短文 "Poetry After Auschwitz – What Adorno Didn’t Say" [2]. 翻译形式为原文在前，一段英文一段中文，粗体部分为本人所加。因个人能力所限，部分德文引文不予翻译，但保留原文，以待方家。
【摘译】
Poetry After Auschwitz – What Adorno Didn’t Say 奥斯维辛之后的诗作：阿多诺没说的话
At the beginning of April, while participating in the defense of an elegant and insightful dissertation on Osip Mandelstam, I stumbled over one of those statements that Adorno never said, but which lots of people think he did: namely, that is was “impossible to write poetry after Auschwitz.”  When my turn came to offer a few comments on the dissertation, I pointed out that what Adorno had said was that it was barbaric to write poetry after Auschwitz, not that it was impossible. And then I went on to note that, in any case, he later took it back, conceding that “perennial suffering has as much right to expression as the tortured have to scream.” What I didn’t say (mainly because I hadn’t really thought about it) was why he would retract a statement that he never made in the first place. 
四月初，我参加了一篇关于 (俄国诗人) 奥西普·曼德尔施塔姆的论文答辩。论文本身优雅且不失洞见，不过我再次碰到了关于阿多诺的一句引言错误，即 “奥斯维辛之后，**无法**再写诗了”。此言与众多其他 “名言” 一样，阿多诺自己从未说过，却有很多人认为是他说的。当轮到我评论时，我指出阿多诺说的不是 “无法再写诗了”，而是 “**奥斯维辛之后，写诗是野蛮的**”。我紧接着强调，他后来收回了这个说法，转而承认 “长久的痛苦遭遇有权获得表达，就像被拷打的人有权发出惨叫”。由于还未曾深入思考，当时我沒仔细说明他这么做的原因。
It’s probably easier to understand why Adorno is almost always misquoted (a collection of his various statements on Auschwitz and poetry is available on HerbertMarcuse.org)  than it is to understand why he made matters worse by behaving as if he’d written what he hadn’t.  It’s just easier to assume that Adorno said that it was “impossible” to write poetry after Auschwitz. It’s one of those things that we assume Adorno must have said because it spares us the difficulty of wrestling with what he actually said. The fact that it is possible to poetry after Auschwitz can be confirmed by pointing to all the poetry that has been written since Auschwitz. The barbarity of continuing to write poetry after Auschwitz requires a discussion of what counts as barbarism — which would force us to ask uncomfortable questions about how we go about distinguishing barbarism from culture.
阿多诺的话总是被错误引用，这大概不难理解，网站 HerbertMarcuse.org 收集了他有关奥斯维辛与写诗的种种言论 (参见 [3]). 难以理解的是他为什么总表现得像真说过那些话一样。我们暂且认为他真的说过奥斯维辛之后**“无法”**再写诗了好了，这样我们就不用为他真说过的那些话分析辩护了……当然，证伪 “奥斯维辛之后无法再写诗” 其实很容易：看看那之后写的众多诗作就行了。然而，如果想搞清楚为什么在奥斯维辛之后继续写诗是 “**野蛮**” 的，就要先弄明白阿多诺说的 “野蛮” 指的是什么，我们将不得不面对 “如何从文化中区分出野蛮” 这个可能引成不适的话题。
The widely misquoted statement about poetry after Auschwitz comes at the close of “Culture Critique and Society,” the opening essay (originally written in 1949) in Prisms (a collection of essays published in 1955). The German reads:
那句被广泛误用的 “奥斯维辛之后无诗作” 引言来自一篇写于 1949 年，题为《文化批判与社会》论文的结尾，该文是 1955 年出版的论文集 Prisms 的第一篇。德文原文是：（略）
Samuel Weber’s English translation — which is keenly aware that German sentences work differently than English ones and takes time to breathe — is scrupulously faithful to Adorno’s text, albeit at the price of leaving a sentence that almost begs to be quoted out of context, a reminder that (for translators as for everyone else) no good deed goes unpunished:
塞缪尔·韦伯的英文翻译高度忠实原文，但由于德文句法跟英文有别，翻译后的句子很容易被断章取义。这也提醒译者及所有人：过犹不及 (此处原文 no good deed goes unpunished 更接近中文里 “好心没好报” 的意思，是说译者的翻译过于忠实，反而容易被人断章取义。这一段译文照搬了木山的翻译，来自 [4]）
To belabor the obvious: “Cultural Criticism and Society” is about the practice of cultural criticism, not poetry. Its fear is that criticism now runs the risk of integration into the culture industry, where it serves as a sort of upscale advertising for cultural wares. The production of cultural goods that have status of things — which, according to Adorno, is not necessarily a bad thing (see his discussion of Beethoven’s final string quartet in the “Culture Industry” chapter of Dialectic of Enlightenment) — has now reached the point where everything, including spirit itself, is turning into a thing (which, to make things perfectly clear, is a bad thing). Therefore, critics should recognize what they’re up against, avoid playing the role of smug guides to the cultural goodies, and try to make sense of the difficulties that the poets are having (even — and, perhaps, especially — in those cases when the poets aren’t all that aware of it). This means that they need to talk about the society in which this poetry is being written. 
众所周知，《文化批判与社会》一文是关于文化批判的，与诗作无关。该文担心的是批判面临被文化工业整合的风险，成为工业化文化产品的高级广告。文化工业生产出具有物化属性的文化产品，这在阿多诺看来并不一定是坏事 (参见他在《启蒙辩证法》一书中《文化工业》一章里关于贝多芬最后几首弦乐四重奏的讨论)。然而，现如今包括精神本身在内的万事万物都有被物化的风险，这绝对不是好事。因此，文艺评论家需认识到他们有不自觉成为文化畅销货推手的风险，应努力避免，并尽量体谅写诗的人们的难处 (甚至，或者说尤其当写诗的人自己还没意识到时)。这就是说，评论家需要结合写作的社会背景来谈诗作。
Adorno retracted the statement that he never actually made at the start of Part III (“Meditations on Metaphysics”) of that Book Nobody Reads Anymore: Negative Dialektik. Here’s the German:
在他那本**已经没人再读 **(此处黑体源自原作者的首字母大写强调) 的《否定的辩证法》第三部分 “对形而上学的沉思” 开头，阿多诺收回了他这个严格来说上从未做出的论断。德文原文如下：（略）
Here’s what E. B. Ashton came up with:
E. B. Ashton 将其翻译为 (以下采用了张峰的译文，来自 [5])：
There is much to criticize in this translation, particularly the intrusive and overly chummy “you,” which robs the passage of what is most immediately at issue. It is not primarily a question about whether you, the reader, can go on living after Auschwitz, but rather one about the status of those who escaped by chance: for example, Theodor Adorno. There is one final sentence in this monstrously long paragraph that drives this point home:
这个翻译可批评的地方很多，尤其是用了指示代词 “你”，代入感太强，又显得过于亲近，以致喧宾夺主。这里要讨论的不是读者，而是像西奥多·阿多诺本人一样从奥斯维辛侥幸逃脱的人的心理状态：他们在逃脱之后能否继续坚持活着。在原文这段过分冗长的话里，下面这个结束句敲定了上述观点 ：(德文原文略)
Here’s Ashton’s translation (which, mercifully, drops the “you”):
The target here is no longer the culture critics who, consciously or unconsciously, render services to the culture industry, but instead their critic, who had escaped.
这是 Ashton 的翻译 (终于不用 “你” 了，以下再次采用了张峰的译文，来自 [5])：
此处谈论的对象不再是自觉或不自觉服务于文化工业的文艺评论家们，而是那些 “逃脱” 了的被评论者。
Thanks to the publication of Adorno’s dream notebook, we know what sorts of things he was dreaming about during the years that were granted to him as a result of the lucky accident of not having been detained on one of his trips from England to Germany during the first years of his exile. At the end of March 1944 he recorded the following:
多亏了阿多诺《梦境笔记》的出版，我们得以知晓他在最初的流亡岁月里都梦到了些什么，这些都要归功于使他从未在从英到德的旅途中被扣留的好运气。1944 年三月末他记录如下：
Here we have a dream from an accidental escapee that manifestly lacks that “coldness” that, if we are to believe Negative Dialektik, made both Auschwitz and the afterlife of those who accidentally survived it possible. At night, Adorno would seem to be confirming the lesson that he had learned from Max Horkheimer’s account of the genesis of “bourgeois subjectivity”: it achievement comes at a terrible price.
此处我们看到了阿多诺这个奥斯维辛的侥幸逃脱者的噩梦。他显然缺乏所谓的 “冷漠”。而根据他的《否定的辩证法》，这种 “冷漠”，恰恰是开设奥斯维辛所必需的，也是那些从其中侥幸生还者日后坚持活着所必需的。夜深人静时，阿多诺似乎是在以他自己的方式确认他从马克斯·霍克海默那里学到的东西：小资产阶级的独立性是真实存在的，只不过这种确认付出了可怕的代价。
Back in Germany, Adorno atoned for his survival by dreaming that he had not survived and that his life had been the hallucination of one who had been slaughtered in 1944.  But, in 1944, having found safety in Los Angeles, he found himself revolted by a dream in which he found himself exacting an atonement of a different sort. Could that same lapse of bourgeois coldness that allowed him to sympathize with the sufferings of the monsters who haunted his dreams (a sympathy that nurtured, if only in his dreams, a sense that he was not himself a monster) have explained why he might be willing to make amends for a statement that he never made?
在德国时，阿多诺会梦到他自己已经遇害，而实际的生活不过是一个已在 1944 年被屠杀者的幻想，以此来逃避对自己侥幸逃生的应激。而当他于 1944 年逃到洛杉矶确认安全后，他却发现被自己的梦境恶心到，在梦里他采用了另一种相反的应激形式 (反过来虐杀纳粹)。他缺乏一种 “小资产阶级的冷漠”，以致开始同情自己噩梦中那些魔鬼的遭遇 (这种同情恐怕也只在他梦里能让他确信自己不是魔鬼). 那么，我们是否能沿用这种 “缺乏冷漠” 的特质，来解释他倾向于修正自己实际上从未下过的论断这种行为？
【讨论与结论】
奥斯维辛之于阿多诺是个极大的心理创伤，以至于产生了反向应激 (梦见自己虐杀纳粹，再被自己的暴行吓出不适)。在《文化批判与社会》一文中，阿多诺说 “奥斯维辛之后写诗是野蛮的”，其实是把奥斯维辛比作文化工业，写诗是作出文艺评论，所谓的 “野蛮”，指的是产业化的文化工业会毒害和规训文艺评论，从而贬低此后文艺评论的价值。而到了《否定的辩证法》之 “对行而上学的沉思” 中，阿多诺已明确表示：“说在奥斯维辛集中营之后便不能再写诗了，这也许是错误的”，也就是说哪怕面临文化工业的规训，也不应该完全否定文艺评论的价值。前者只是说写诗是 “野蛮” 的，而后者自我否定的标的是说写诗是 “不可能” 的，两者并不等同，这就是为什么上述译文原作者说阿多诺 “修正自己实际上从未下过的论断”。
综上所述，阿多诺从未说过 “奥斯维辛之后不能写诗”，更不认为此时写诗是 “残忍” 的，所谓的 “野蛮”，只是一个比喻，用来说明文化工业对文艺评论的毒害，与具体奥斯维辛事件后的诗歌创作没有半点关系。本文这一观点，除了摘译引文，亦有诸多旁证，参见 [7, 8].
