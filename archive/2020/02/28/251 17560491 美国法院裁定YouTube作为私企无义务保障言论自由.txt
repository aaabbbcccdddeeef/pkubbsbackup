累了，不翻译了hhh
Ruling against PragerU's First Amendment claim was ultimately a "straightforward" matter, the appeals-court ruling today said:
<font color="#0000c0">**Both sides say that the sky will fall if we do not adopt their position. PragerU prophesizes living under the tyranny of big-tech, possessing the power to censor any speech it does not like. YouTube and several amicus curiae, on the other hand, foretell the undoing of the Internet if online speech is regulated. While these arguments have interesting and important roles to play in policy discussions concerning the future of the Internet, they do not figure into our straightforward application of the First Amendment. Because the state action doctrine precludes constitutional scrutiny of YouTube's content moderation pursuant to its Terms of Service and Community Guidelines, we affirm the district court's dismissal of PragerU's First Amendment claim.**</font>
The decision, by San Francisco's Ninth Circuit appeals court, rejected the conservative news outlet's claims that YouTube had breached the First Amendment by censoring its content.
PragerU said it was still "not done fighting for free speech" and the appeals court "got this one wrong".
Jim Killock, from the Open Rights Group, said the ruling was "uncontroversial" and followed established interpretations of free speech law.
But he also said the case was part of a continuing row over who made censorship decisions online: "Instinctively, if something is in a public space, why should some content be restricted? Why should a company make that decision?" he said.
The First Amendment to the US constitution is part of the country's landmark Bill of Rights, from 1791. Among the declarations, it guarantees that the government will not "abridge" the freedom of speech in law.
That guarantee is between the government and the people - and does not usually involve private companies. But there are rare exceptions in cases where a company becomes a "state actor", performing a public function.How far do free speech protections go in the US?Facebook apologises to right-wing siteTwitter admits 'unfairly' hiding accounts
In the case of PragerU, YouTube had removed advertising from dozens of videos that present right-wing views, setting some of them to "restricted mode" for adult viewing only.
The channel is part of a non-profit founded by conservative radio host Dennis Prager, and has nearly 2.5 million subscribers, but it has attracted significant criticism for its videos, including ones on "harnessing" masculine aggression and the nature of Islam.
PragerU argued that YouTube's size and power meant that the world's biggest video platform was effectively a public space, and it was censoring conservative viewpoints.
But the court decided on a "straightforward application" of the first amendment, and dismissed the appeal.
"Despite YouTube's ubiquity and its role as a public-facing platform, it remains a private forum, not a public forum," the court said.
PragerU's Craig Strazzeri said: "Of course this ruling is disappointing, but we won't stop fighting and spreading public awareness of Big Tech's censorship of conservative ideas."Censorship or moderation
Mr Killock said the case reflected the problem with content moderation in large companies such as Facebook and Google (which owns YouTube).
Much of the dispute centres around content that is perfectly legal - but upsetting to some groups.
He highlighted a model of content moderation recently announced by Facebook, where an independent oversight board will have the power to overrule the company's decisions.
It will be led by British human rights expert Thomas Hughes, who said the board is committed to protecting free expression and human rights.
"The problem is they're so large, any restriction affects a large number of people," he said. "Setting the boundaries is a very complex topic," Mr Killock said.
"They do become de facto public spaces - and whatever decision they come to will be controversial".

原告肯定会上诉的
而且这个案子肯定是不搞到最高法院不罢休的（无论二审是谁败诉）

对。YouTube不是一般意义的私企，而是有着强大公共影响力的私企，自然要承担公共责任，包括保障公众言论自由。类比一些著名的私立高等院校，同样需要承担起一部分公立高等院校的社会责任的

那你猜如果这个案子到了最高法院，保守派到底会为了维护非政府主体的不保障言论自由的自由，从而让保守派原告败诉，还是为了支持保守派原告，把宪法义务强加到个人/私企头上？

我觉得有可能会这么下判：
一是根据是否根据政府指令，根据任何一级政府指令进行的删帖违反言论自由
二是根据该特定平台在言论空间的支配力，支配力越大的越接近于公共空间，要更严格地保障言论自由；反之则接近于私人空间，所有者的管制力可以首先更少
三是根据删贴的原则是用户及其代表制定的（比如百度贴吧的吧规一类），抑或是平台自行制定的，前者一般不违反言论自由
