俄勒冈州检出去年12月感染病毒产生IgG抗体病例

#p 22186570 lea 无爱即无忧 2020-04-09 01:35:03
美国俄勒冈州检出一个去年12月患过新冠病毒且有IgG抗体的人。
这个测试从俄勒冈州的8个城市随机取了40个人的血浆，测试检测了他们的IgG抗体，也就是至少一个月以前的感染情况。
结果发现：32号有强烈的抗体反应。他自己反映去年12月得了非常严重的疾病。35号和32号是好朋友，弱阳性，且反映在今年1月份得过“感冒”。    
另外，这40人里面16人IgG抗体阳性占率40%，之前武汉撤离回香港的540多香港居民只测出3.8%IgG抗体阳性。
说明新冠病毒在美国传播的时间远超武汉。

就没人看原文的么，这个明显有曲解的中文说法还在传。。。文章里明明写的是4个人阳性，16个人那个说的是问卷调查自认为得过新冠的。而且文章里还特别指出了这个抗体检测不排除在接触过其他冠状病毒而没接触过新冠的情况下产生cross reactive抗体，以及这个文章作者似乎是俄勒冈州立大学的做实验分析的研究助理，本身实验的严谨性也成疑。就这么被国内媒体断章取义过度解读到处传也是无语

确实问题很多，不过...
4例阳性占样本10%，仍高于报道提到的香港调查结果...
目前检测IgG抗体的工具，敏感性和特异性可以接近99%，文章说“不排除”啥意思...
一个研究助理是否就能完成调查报告，“严谨性成疑”是何指...
都“无语”或许就会让人觉得，原报道虽不中亦不远，反驳可以有也不过聊胜于无...

看了下，好像是科研文章的格式，并不像是社会新闻报道的样子。
科研成果需要经过同行评议，正式发表，结果才比较可信的。没发表，只能算一个，可能对(也可能不对)的结论。

感觉类似的报道近期ms也不少（虽然样本数量都偏低，而且基本上都不确凿），但是对于这些报道我有另一个疑惑的点：
虽然新冠很多症状较轻、自愈率不低，但新冠感染的大多数病例都存在肺部病变；
那为什么现在所能听闻的“疑似曾患有新冠，或被误诊为流感etc.”（无论有没有检测IgG抗体）的例子，几乎没有声称自己曾发生/诊断了肺部病变的?
p.s.我是感觉，要是有几个曾被诊断为肺炎，现在又检测出IgG阳性的人出现，那肯定大新闻…

你自己砍了原文么，原文都没说99%的准确性，这原文里作者自己写的不一定是新冠感染造成的这几例阳性你怎么就这么自信。。。
你说的香港报道的结果是啥，撤侨回来这个是核酸检测吧，那是确定感染的，跟这个抗体检测是两码事。。。

所以把10%的数据夸大成40%的数据，然后无限外推原文作者自己都没说的结论就是好习惯了。这样的非同行评审文章同行里拿出来看看作为研究就行了，没任何专业背景的人就这么恶意曲解放到网上大肆传播就是好习惯了？

哦哦。。。。我觉得一般这种有新闻效果的结论的文章结论一旦被证实(通过同行评议)，会有官方媒体正式跟进报道的(毕竟这是一个这么好的打脸美国的材料)。
没有经过同行评议，没有发表，多数的版友也不是专家，是没办法判断真假以及结论是否可靠的。所以就先搁置，等等看吧。。。。。

原文没说啊，我查了一下IgG检测的敏感性和特异性数据，有80%以上就发出来的文章...
是不是没到95%以上就算“不排除”呢，还是没到100%都算“不排除”呢...
“两码事”是啥意思，你需要解释，得结合着报道的观点...

看一下原文有这么难么，这原文也就两三篇高中英语阅读理解的长度，作者自己的话你自己看吧：
“Other non-COVID-19 coronaviruses are prevalent in the community and there is evidence that some individuals possess antibodies that recognize multiple coronaviruses.
That means positive results in this assay could indicate past infection to a non-COVID-19 coronavirus, not past infection to COVID-19 itself. However, the positive signal does indicate preexisting antibody recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein. This would likely offer some protection against an encounter with COVID-19.
Responses to the questionnaire indicate that people generally overestimate their exposure to COVID-19. Only 4 people tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 but there were 15 who thought that they had the virus in the past. Most people reported having a cold or flu sometime since January 1, 2020 and that may explain the misperception about COVID-19 exposure.”
“This report has shown that a community serum survey can detect individuals who haven’t had a COVID-19 clinical test or diagnosis but produce antibodies that recognize SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1. Therefore serum antibody assays could be used as a quick and cheap screening tool to evaluate community spread, preexisting humoral responses or potential convalescent serum donors.”

Virus in Wonderland
March 28, 2020
By Anna Morris, Freedom Fighters of America
     Some of us in this Idaho/Oregon border region wonder if we had COVID-19 illness in mid- to late December 2019? We had a supposed viral illness during which some people completely lost the senses of taste and smell. Last week anosmia and dysgeusia, medical terms for loss of smell and taste, were announced as possible early signs of, or in some cases the only signs of COVID-19 disease. It is now  widely recommended that people with these symptoms immediately enter self quarantine for two weeks.
     I live on my small ranch in Washington County, Idaho, which is located in a fairly isolated high desert region on the east bank of the Snake River. A large family with children was sharing my house until recently. In December 2019 a couple of those kids visited relatives in northeastern Oregon. One of these relatives drives school bus so has ample opportunity to absorb any infectious diseases going through school kids.
     On returning to Idaho, a preteen boy fell ill with severe fatigue and fever of 101 F (38.33 C). After a few days he seemed to be getting better but his grandmother noticed he kept adding salt to a cup of chicken broth, a ridiculous amount of salt, like the whole shaker-full if he had not been stopped. The boy had no sense of taste which lasted a few days before it returned as he rapidly recovered. The total time of his illness was around seven days.
     Two babies in the family, two years old and younger, were feverish and fussy for a few days but had no other specific signs or symptoms.
     The boy's grandmother who had helped nurse him subsequently lost her appetite, had mild sore throat and respiratory symptoms then lost her sense of taste and smell. She describes the symptoms as, "It was pretty much coming down with pneumonia, for me." This was late December/early January and since that time this woman has had two diagnosed bouts of pneumonia treated with antibiotics and other medications. These last illnesses are  of the "walking pneumonia" class as she has remained active though severely fatigued.
     As soon as the boy became ill I moved into another house on the ranch. I have a peculiar, dangerous heart rate and viruses can be very serious for me. Nevertheless I had been in close quarters with the children who were ill. On Christmas Eve I awoke with a mild sore throat which eased with a cup of hot coffee. I was severely tired that day and kind of dragged through the holidays till the first of January. I then developed mild respiratory symptoms, so mild I was not sure I was ill. One night I woke up with the sensation that I was choking to death and coughed up a peculiar and large mass of stringy phlegm. After that I got an eight day migraine and was absolutely prostrate for a couple weeks. I experienced severe depression for the first time in my life and I told my doctor I felt like I had pneumonia. She said my lungs were "clear" and prescribed an Albuterol inhaler which helped. Even so, it is only in the last week that I have begun to feel somewhat normal. The depression began to lift a couple weeks ago, over eight weeks after the initial signs of illness.
     Last week news articles from Europe began reporting the loss of taste and smell in connection with COVID-19. 
     Around this time a friend shared a Facebook post from a nurse in the northeastern corner of Oregon, describing a rash of respiratory illnesses in December 2019 during which schools closed for disinfection. (All I can find similar to this is schools in that area closed in December due to Norovirus.) She noted there had been deaths among older people, supposedly from this unusually severe, non-flu, respiratory illness. (This posting cannot be found at this time.)
     Continuing anecdotally, one of the first  confirmed COVID-19 cases in Oregon was in Weston, Oregon, Umatilla County in the same vicinity where the boy was possibly infected. This was February 2020. Various articles noted that that man worked at the local casino on tribal lands, though not directly with the public or with food. A couple days before he showed symptoms he had attended a middle school basketball tournament in Weston, it was reported. This male patient over 60 years old was soon hospitalized in Walla Walla, Washington, over the border from Oregon.
     This is somewhat close to home for me so I have been watching the emerging cases in Oregon and Idaho counties. More than a week after the first Umatilla County case there was a second, said to have been in close contact with the first. There seem to be no other cases and no community spread in the area. (I must here caution the readers. Today the East Oregonian newspaper has an article claiming COVID-19 cases in eastern Oregon are not being reported to the public because the populations in the area are so small, those infected could be "outed". Then there was some mumbling about more "transparency" which I translate as Oregon Health Authority will tell fewer lies. All this is fodder for another article so I will let the subject LIE for now, so to speak. It looks like a third COVID case in Umatilla County is being counted today.)
     On the surface one cannot help but wonder if the COVID-19 virus has not already visited the area and if there is a level of immunity present in the population?
     There are various estimates about how the novel H1 N1 1918 influenza virus mutated. Some authors and researchers believe there was a first pass of the virus, say in 1916 or 1917, which was milder and may have not been particularly noticed. These researchers theorize a second pass of the virus, after a deadly mutation, killed 50 to 100 million people in the 1918 pandemic. Following that the virus became milder again and is still with us according to various sources. Is it possible COVID-19 has been around for awhile and has become more lethal in a second pass?
     At this time Italy, so hard hit with COVID-19 in the past month, is reportedly looking back at some cases of severe pneumonia in that region going back perhaps as far as November/December 2019. A comment made on an international forum of which I am a member, said Italy may disinter the dead from that outbreak to try to obtain viral samples. This story is unfolding at this time.
     I have been active on this forum and on Twitter. A number of people respond with their own tales of having peculiar viral illness and loss of taste and smell dating back before reports of the virus came out of Wuhan China. Some of us wonder if the virus has an origin other than China. We wonder if the original site might be in northern Italy or even the northern U.S.? Is it possible, I wonder, that this devastating killer virus could have arisen in the underpopulated, high desert, border region where I live?
     Since COVID-19 testing abilities in the U.S. appear to be woefully inadequate and unavailable, no one has any idea how many currently infected individuals exist in the country. Some sources claim there is an antibody test that can show if someone has had the disease. I for one would love to see wide spread antibody testing done in this Idaho/Oregon border area. Until then we will have to wonder.
