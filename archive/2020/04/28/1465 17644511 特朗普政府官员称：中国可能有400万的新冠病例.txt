Now, a Trump administration official tells Fox News they estimate the PRC has miscalculated and underreported the true tally nationwide by at least a factor of 50. “PRC numbers as reported today seem to be arithmetically impossible,” the official said.
“Again, we don’t know the real numbers today, but we do know the about 80,000 infections and 4,000 deaths as reported by the Chinese Communist Party propaganda are not even remotely close,” the person added.
Intelligence sources, asked about recent reports of funeral homes in Wuhan becoming overwhelmed by the volume of new corpses and plagued by a shortage of urns to hold virus victims' remains, declined to confirm the existence of classified satellite images. They did affirm, however, that the reporting is within the realm of possibility based on the evidentiary record.
In support of this claim, officials point to the existence of seven funeral homes inside Wuhan city with a total incineration capacity of about 2,000 corpses per day. They also flag recent reporting that incinerators have been in near constant use for 24 hours per day over the past several weeks. They note that, at this rate, the city's incineration capacity nears 60,000 corpses per month.
Sources also tell Fox News that between March 23 and April 4, the citywide goal included the return of 500 urns to Wuhan families per day, or about one urn per minute of each day, in accordance with official social distancing recommendations. This goal was enacted in order to support the national Qing Ming festival, a day in which Chinese citizens traditionally honor deceased relatives. Based on this official guidance, sources arrive at a lower-end total tally of 45,500 corpses incinerated and returned to their families during this 13-day period.

计算标准莫不是把这段时期武汉死亡的人全部算成因为新冠病毒死亡，然后再用5%或者稍低的死亡百分比推测武汉病例数，继而推断中国总病例？
