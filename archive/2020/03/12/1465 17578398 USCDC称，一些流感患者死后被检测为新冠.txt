CDC director says some coronavirus-related deaths have been found posthumously  
During
 the House Oversight Committee discussion on the novel coronavirus 
response, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention said some deaths from coronavirus have been discovered 
posthumously.  
Rep.
 Harley Rouda asked CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield if it’s possible 
that some flu patients may have been misdiagnosed and actually had 
coronavirus.
"The
 standard practice is the first thing you do is test for influenza, so 
if they had influenza they would be positive," Redfield said.
Rouda then asked Redfield if they are doing posthumous testing.
Redfield
 said there has been "a surveillance system of deaths from pneumonia, 
that the CDC has; it’s not in every city, every state, every hospital.”
Rouda
 followed up and asked, “So we could have some people in the United 
States dying for what appears to be influenza when in fact it could be 
the coronavirus?”
The doctor replied that “some cases have actually been diagnosed that way in the United States today.”
