周三记者会，有人问川普为什么很多无症状的运动员有机会测病毒，但很多有症状普通美国人没有机会测。川普说：“不知道！”
President Trump wasn’t able to say when asked Wednesday why many non-symptomatic professional athletes have had access to coronavirus testing while many sick Americans don’t.
“You'd have to ask them that question,” Trump said.
“Should that happen?” the reporter followed up 
Trump responded, “No, I wouldn’t say so, but perhaps that’s been the story of life.”
