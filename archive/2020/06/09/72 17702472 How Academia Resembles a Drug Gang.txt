Abstract: Academic systems rely on the existence of a supply of 
“outsiders” ready to forgo wages and employment security in exchange for
 the prospect of uncertain security, prestige, freedom and reasonably 
high salaries that tenured positions entail. Drawing on data from the 
US, Germany and the UK, Alexandre Afonso
 looks at how the academic job market is structured in many respects 
like a drug gang, with an expanding mass of outsiders and a shrinking 
core of insiders.
